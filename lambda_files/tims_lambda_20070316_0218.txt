</p><p>Wow.  ToonTalk appears to be a serious product to teach concurrent constraint programming, to children, by means of the following metaphors:</p>
<blockquote><div><ul >
<li>computation :: city</li>
<li>actor or process or object :: house</li>
<li>methods :: robots</li>
<li>method preconditions :: contents of thought bubble</li>
<li>method actions :: actions taught to robot</li>
<li>tuples or messages or vectors :: boxes</li>
<li>actor spawning 	:: loaded trucks</li>
<li>actor termination :: bombs</li>
<li>channel transmit capabilities :: birds</li>
<li>channel receive capabilities :: nests</li>
</ul>
<p>Another way to understand the computational model of ToonTalk is to consider what you can train robots to do:</p>
<ul >
<li>send a message by giving a box or pad to a bird</li>
<li>spawn a new agent by dropping a box and a team of robots into a truck</li>
<li>perform simple primitive operations (e.g. +, -, *) by dropping a pad on a pad</li>
<li>terminate an agent by setting off a bomb</li>
</ul></div></blockquote>
<p>Again, wow.  That's one hell of a metaphor there!</p>
