Monads in various languages
This problem appears to exist
<p>This problem appears to exist generally when translating comprehensions into any strongly-typed language without type deduction.  Python generator expressions avoid this by being weakly typed.</p><p>

Requiring explicit type annotations would be unfortunate.  For example, using comprehension syntax for monadic parser combinators is very convenient, but would be about 50% more verbose if type annotations were required.</p><p>

Are there any languages in which monad operations are convenient and readable without comprehensions?  For example, complex Haskell monad operations seem considerably less readable without the helper syntax.</p>
