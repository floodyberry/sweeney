Closures and mutability
Re: Closures and mutability
<p>I absolutely agree with Erik, though I wouldn't have seen it this way without having implemented closures every possible wrong way and finally come around to this way of thinking.</p><p>

It's quite a change from the C mindset and its simple "data structures &lt;-&gt; blocks of memory" view of the world, but there is great value to forcing all variables in a language to be constant, and expose mutability purely through typed references, solely through the new_ref, read_ref, and write_ref constructs.</p>
