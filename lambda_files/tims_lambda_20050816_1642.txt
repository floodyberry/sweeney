large imperative code --&gt; functional
Display Lists
<p>Immediate mode OpenGL is gratuitously imperative.  Keep in mind that the approach described above isn't functional; it's an imperative program abstracted over Haskell's IO Monad.
</p><p>A pure functional approach would be to regard graphics rendering as a pure operation Render :: DisplayList -&gt; FrameBuffer, where a DisplayList is a list of elements of an algebraic datatype describing all OpenGL operations, and FrameBuffer is perhaps a 2D array of RGBA pixel values.  Rendering, at that level, is purely functional, in that the output of Render should (at least for a sane device) be a referentially transparent function of its parameter.</p>
