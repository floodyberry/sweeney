<h4>Getting closer...</h4>

<p>But we're not quite there with 224 yet.&nbsp; The guys have been beating on internal
test versions for the past few days, and we've been polishing the code.&nbsp; It's both a
blessing and a curse that the Unreal code is evolving by leaps and bounds, gaining major
new features all the time.&nbsp; This approach makes testing each new patch a major
effort.&nbsp; Though, 224 will be especially worth the effort because of the in-game
server browser and level-of-detail optimizations.</p>

<p>224 will probably happen late this week.</p>

<p>Here is a <a href="http://www.next-generation.com/jsmid/news/6387.html">Next-Generation article</a> where Mark Rein shamelessly plugs the patch.</p>

<h4>Network Cross-Compatibility</h4>

<p>(warning: nitty-gritty technical info)</p>

<p>An interesting technology feature in 224 is a new method of evolving .u files in a way
that is backwards-compatible for network play.</p>

<p>One of the things that has always bothered me about past versions of Unreal is that
clients and servers had to have exactly-matching .u files in order to play together.
&nbsp; This has meant that every recent Unreal patch has broken network compatibility,
leaving some players orphaned.&nbsp; The reason behind this is that Unreal's network code
(described in detail <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/network.htm">here</a>)
uses the positions of objects within .u files as a &quot;common point of reference&quot;
which clients and servers use to map objects between each others' address spaces. &nbsp;
Some scheme of this nature is necessary when network code is generalized like Unreal's is,
with the same scripts executing on the client and server, passing arbitrary data back and
forth, with the network code transparently coordinating the game world.</p>

<p>I've been aware of some solutions to this problem all along (such as &quot;send all
object names as strings&quot;), but they all sacrificed bandwidth.</p>

<p>Recently, I found a no-compromises way to enable .u files to evolve incrementally
without losing compatibility.&nbsp; Now, when we release a new version, we copy the .u
files into a new developers-only subdirectory \Unreal\SystemConform.&nbsp; Then we can
make minor changes to our scripts and recompile new versions that are network-compatible
with the old ones.&nbsp; When recompiling and saving a .u file such as
\Unreal\System\Engine.u, the script compiler now examines the existing file
\Unreal\SystemConform\Engine.u, and makes the new version &quot;conform to the layout of
the original&quot;.&nbsp; In addition, when a client connects to a server, they both
negotiate to figure out who has the earliest version of each .u file, and both talk about
objects &quot;in relation to that old .u file&quot;.&nbsp; This enables compatibility
without any loss in performance or bandwidth usage.</p>

<p>Really major updates will always break code assumptions and require downloading an
update.&nbsp; This approach just makes minor incremental updates possible, enables us to
test spot-fixes on the net, and generally makes our programming lives easier.</p>
