<h4>Unreal 225 musings</h4>

<p>The recent work on 225 has been focused on improving server performance and stability,
and it has been paying off really well.&nbsp; It turns out that 224's server code was
noticeably slower than 220, as a result of some code improvements I made but didn't test
and time rigorously.&nbsp; The two bottleneck routines in the server are the visibility
tracer and the actor replicator.&nbsp; I've been making the visibility tracer faster by
processing all actors simultaneously and optimizing the code for a pure &quot;yes/no&quot;
visibility test, rather than using the more general (and slower) line trace routine built
into the engine.&nbsp; The actor replicator has gained significant speedups from a
combination of low-level optimization (to the bit-stream writer, and replication condition
caching code), and a new time-stamping system that speeds up replication by up to 50% on
servers with high player counts.</p>

<p>Now, the 225 server is faster than all previous versions, and I'm working on some
further improvements over the next few days.</p>

<p>As many server admins have pointed out to us, if we can double Unreal's server
performance, admins will be able to run twice as many servers on their machines!</p>

<h4>Things That Are Cool</h4>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ssafe/">Microsoft Visual SourceSafe</a>:
    &nbsp; Anybody who is programming on a large project without using a source-control system
    is nuts!&nbsp; SourceSafe provides a central repository for all code, and enables
    programmers to check out files and work on them without their changes
    &quot;colliding&quot; with those of other programmers.&nbsp; SourceSafe also tracks all
    changes to all files since the beginning of a project, which has been incredibly useful in
    developing Unreal, because it enables us to examine our past code changes when tracking
    down bugs.&nbsp; Finally, SourceSafe is excellent for managing &quot;branched&quot; projects: when we split Unreal 224 apart from the Unreal Tournament codebase, SourceSafe
    managed the files' shared history automatically.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.glsetup.com/">GLsetup</a>:&nbsp; Now that Microsoft
    has publicly committed to dropping the ball on 3D hardware driver distribution with
    DirectX7, GLsetup is the only hope for game developers who want their game to <span class="italic">work</span>
    on users' computers out-of-the-box.&nbsp; The PC is already plagued by driver problems,
    and the classic symptom is users having to go to the web and download new drivers to get
    new games working.&nbsp; The world would be a much better place if Microsoft took a
    leadership role in driver updates, by keeping the DirectX redistribution continually
    refreshed with new QA-certified drivers, thus assuring that new games always work
    &quot;out of the box&quot; -- if that happened, PC gaming would be a lot closer to the
    level of reliability of console games.&nbsp; But Microsoft isn't doing that, and GLsetup
    is a grassroots effort to solve the problem.</li>
