<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/moddevweek_b.shtm">keynote
article</a> on the state of mod development, by our own Brandon &quot;GreenMarine&quot;
Reinhart.&nbsp; This is the first feature in <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/">GameSpy's</a>
new <a href="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/moddevweek_a.shtm">Mod
Developer Week</a> feature.</p>

<p>Upcoming articles in the series feature Jesse Taylor from the Infiltration
mod team for Unreal Tournament, and David &quot;crt&quot; Wright of Rocket Arena
for Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament.</p>
<p>Now is an exciting time for mod development, as the best teams of enthusiasts
are earning tremendous praise, opening up serious biz opportunities.&nbsp; This
dynamic reminds me of the shareware game business around 1991 when Epic,
Apogee/3D Realms and id Software were born.&nbsp; Back then, we were just a
handful of kids making games for our own enjoyment, and releasing them online
for others to enjoy -- hoping that we might be able to make some money to pay
the bills.</p>
<p>Today all three companies are industry leaders.</p>
<p>Now, think about where today's best mod authors will be in 9 years!</p>
<p>The advantage that enabled id, 3D Realms, and Epic to rise to the top is
something that today's mod authors have too: we're in the middle of a thriving
community, and that gives us an awesome feedback loop.&nbsp; If we release
something that sucks -- whether it's something big like Unreal 1's network code,
or something subtle like weapon balancing -- then thousands of people will email
us complaining until we fix it.&nbsp; Thousands of smart people besides
ourselves are expanding the game universe by running web sites, making mods,
building levels, and running servers, and they let us know what they like and
dislike.&nbsp; In this kind of pressure-cooker environment, only good games and
good ideas survive.</p>
