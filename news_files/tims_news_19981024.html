<h4>Almost there...</h4>

<p>The latest Direct3D support is now integrated into the Unreal codebase.&nbsp; It will
be in the upcoming 218 patch in &quot;public beta&quot; form.&nbsp; It hasn't gone through
wide testing yet, but we and our partners have been testing it a lot internally on Windows
95 and 98.&nbsp; It's looking good on the next-generation 3D cards (Riva TNT, Matrox G200,
Savage 3D), though high-level optimizations are planned that will boost performance
further.</p>

<p>The Voodoo2 multitexture code is in, thanks to the efforts of Jack Mathews at 3dfx.</p>

<p>I'm doing some final Internet play testing and tweaking on the patch.&nbsp; My
&quot;torture test&quot; environment is an ISP connection at 24.4K with 400 msec ping.
&nbsp;&nbsp; If it's playable on that, it should be playable on anything. :) &nbsp;
Yesterday's testing revealed a few last-minute problems that I'm working on now.</p>

<h4>More discussion on CORBA</h4>

<p><a href="mailto:sterren@iae.nl">William van der Sterren</a> provided this insight into
CORBA with respect to realtime apps:</p>

<blockquote><div>
  <p>In general, CORBA causes too much overhead and latency to be a
  server/clients gaming protocol. This is due to IIOP's (the default inter-ORB protocol) use
  of TCP/IP, and the use of large packet sizes (compared to the dedicated bit-tuned gaming
  protocols being used in,&nbsp; for example, Quake2 and Unreal). Though support for IIOP is
  mandatory, an ORB vendor can deploy more efficient (or more secure) protocols between
  'his' ORBs, optionally using other network protocols. By default, CORBA calls are
  synchronous (that is, the calling object is blocked until a response is received from the
  called object). Such a connection-oriented call is best implemented using TCP. </p>
  <p>CORBA also supports so-called 'one-way' operations, that&nbsp; enable the caller to
  continue processing immediately&nbsp; after making the call - the call is non-blocking.
  Here, it might make sense to use UDP as an underlying protocol, provided you deal with the
  unreliability at the application level (the 'call' might not arrive at the client). Some
  specialized high-performance ORBs, such as Nortel's RCP-ORB,
  &lt;http://www.nortel.com/RCP-ORB/&gt;, use other transport protocols than TCP for one-way
  calls. Most ORBs implement optimized mechanisms for 'intra-server' and 'intra-process'
  communication (not that relevant for multi-player gaming).</p>

<p>I'll post more thoughts on the topic in the future.&nbsp; With Unreal,
distributed object models are already playing a role in multiplayer gaming, but only in a
&quot;tip of the iceberg&quot; sort of way.&nbsp; This kind of technology will expand very
interestingly in the future.</p>
