<h4>On Our World Domination Plans</h4>

<p>Ok, the headline is exaggerating a bit.&nbsp; Still, there are some cool things
happening with the Unreal engine that we find very exciting--uses of the technology that
we never dreamed would exist a couple years ago.</p>

<p>For example, as the latest <a href="http://www.planetunreal.com/">PlanetUnreal</a>
news story describes, the <a href="http://www.digitalo.com/">Digitalo
Design</a> team is building a &quot;virtual reconstruction&quot; of the <a
href="http://www.planetunreal.com/index.asp?images.asp?interviews/images/vrnd1big.jpg">Notre Dame Cathedral</a>.&nbsp; And it looks jaw-droppingly amazing!

&nbsp; The team here, busy working on Unreal Tournament, is very jealous about the polygon
counts these guys are using (the lucky bastards don't have to worry about the CPU impact
of 12 players deathmatching in their creation!)</p>

<p>Also, the rapidly-growing independent news site, <a href="http://www.unrealengine.com/">UnrealEngine.com</a>, is covering lots of other Unreal engine projects
that fall way outside the &quot;first person action&quot; stereotype, such as Hasbro's <a href="http://www.unrealengine.com/pic/pic_990701Big.jpg">Nerf Arena Blast</a>
(see <a href="http://www.avault.com/news/displaynews.asp?story=6301999-102335">AVault preview</a>) -- as well as the other well-known projects from our <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Partners.htm">partners</a>.</p>

<p>There are other interesting things happening with the tech, behind the scenes.&nbsp; A
number of schools (ranging from high schools to universities) are using UnrealScript to
each real-time object-oriented programming.&nbsp; Several university masters-degree thesis
projects are centered around projects involving the engine.&nbsp; Some architects are
using the editor to generate real-time architectural walkthroughs.&nbsp; At least two
Silicon Valley startups are pitching completely non-game projects incorporating the Unreal
engine to investors.</p>

<h4>What's really happening here?</h4>

<p>What we're seeing is part of a larger trend that will continue to grow.&nbsp; Remember
ten years ago, when PC's were very weak compared to the state-of-the art: SGI
workstations, and the Unix workstations from HP, Sun, and Apollo?</p>

<p>Now, a $2000 Pentium III PC with a Voodoo3 or TNT2 card eclipses the performance of a
$30,000 SGI for real-time rendering.&nbsp; The CPU is faster, the fill rate is faster.
When I first saw an SGI Reality Engine, my impression was, &quot;Holy cow, I can't believe
how much better this is than my '286!&quot;&nbsp; But nowadays, the best 3D games look far
cooler than anything you see running on a Reality Engine.</p>

<p>That entire segment of the high tech industry, the one containing non-PC workstations,
SGI's high end hardware, simulation tools vendors, and so on, is falling off a cliff and
disappearing.&nbsp; One-time leaders like SGI and Intergraph are turning into niche
players, who are losing out badly to the new guys like Dell, Gateway, NVidia, and 3dfx who
were born and bred in the consumer, high volume, low-price PC era.</p>

<p>The result is that projects, like the Notre Dame reconstruction, architectual
walkthroughs, and training simulations--which were once the realm of high-end SGI's--are
now coming to the PC in droves.&nbsp; Soon, they'll all be here.</p>

<h4>The Economics</h4>

<p>What we're seeing in processors, 3D accelerators, and games is a fundamentally
different level of technological progress than happens in other markets. Industrial era
businesses, like car manufacturing, and limited by raw materials and labor.&nbsp; Most of
what you pay for a car goes to materials, labor, and the other economic components of the
industrial pipeline (like transportation, insurance, and so on).&nbsp; Years of tweaking
the process have made manufacturing near optimally efficient, so future progress goes very
slowly, gaining perhaps 2%-3% productivity per year.&nbsp; That's why there is no Moore's
law for car performance.</p>

<p>But in our business, the cost of raw materials is insignificant, so innovation is
driven by volume and R&amp;D investment.&nbsp; A 500 MHz Pentium III now costs the same to
manufacture as a 60 MHz Pentium cost in its day, or a 386-16 long ago.&nbsp; A retail game
contains around $2.50 of raw materials (box and CD) and sells for around $49.95.&nbsp; So,
manufacturing isn't a limiting factor here.</p>

<p>Still, games, processors, and 3D cards require a tremendous up-front investment in
R&amp;D and facilities.&nbsp; It takes lots of people and a lot of capital to develop a
game, design a chip, or design and build a manufacturing plant. The difference is, this
investment is a fixed cost--you pay it once, then you have the ability manufacture as many
games or chips as you desire at an (approximately) insignificant cost. </p>

<p>The remaining piece of the puzzle is the &quot;winner take all&quot; nature of
technology markets.&nbsp; Since manufacturing costs are small, price differences are
minor, leadership goes to the companies that have the best high-volume products. &nbsp;
Therefore, everyone invests heavily in R&amp;D, and attempts to produce the best product
in hopes of selling tons of chips or games or engines.&nbsp; When they do this
successfully, they make a profit and plow it back into the business to get further ahead.

&nbsp; Most R&amp;D and capital-investment hungry markets work this way; it's why you only
see a handful of prominent CPU makers, 3D card makers, and engine developers.&nbsp; The
ones who delivered were successful early on and reinvested in their continued growth; and
those who didn't deliver either out-of-business or are falling apart now.</p>

<h4>The Result: General-Purpose Solutions Win</h4>

<p>The result is that high-volume general-purpose hardware and software is quickly gaining
the lead in <span class="italic">absolute</span> performance.&nbsp; This trend will only accelerate as the PC
market becomes larger and the R&amp;D investments grow.&nbsp; The ramifications are: </p>


<ul>
  <li>Specialized software and hardware loses out to general-purpose.&nbsp; The company that
    focuses on generality (for example, a CPU, or a 2D+3D graphics accelerator, or a
    general-purpose game engine) has the expectation of higher sales, and can make so much
    more of an R&amp;D investment that special-purpose solutions can't compete (for example,
    3D-only accelerators, or a once-off engine powering a single game).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Volume and increasing R&amp;D investment enable 3dfx and NVidia to sell millions of $150
    graphics cards that outperform SGI's $50,000 solution which sells 1000 units.&nbsp; That
    has the effect of crushing SGI's business model, even though companies like 3dfx aren't
    even consciously trying to compete with SGI.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>When a company like Epic or id Software builds a 3D engine, we do it with the
    expectation of it powering games that sell a few million copies, between our games and
    licensee projects.&nbsp; We make money from each one, and that realization drives
    investment in making more and better tools.&nbsp; This gives our engines a price,
    performance, and feature advantage over &quot;in-house&quot; engines made specifically for
    one game, and over less-capable engines designed for niche markets.&nbsp; We amortize our
    R&amp;D investment over ~10X more units sold.&nbsp; This licensing model has already
    proven successful with mainstream game developers, but now it's starting to overflow into
    non-game markets too.&nbsp; We have this great 3D engine, why not use it for your
    architectural walkthrough?</li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li>As a result of widespread interest, thriving ecosystems develop around successful
    general-purpose products.&nbsp; For example, there are hundreds of web sites dedicated to
    3dfx hardware, and lots of developers optimizing their games for 3dfx.&nbsp; There are
    many hundreds of web sites covering Unreal and licensee projects; thousands of kickass
    aspiring level designers building maps and making them available online; many licensees
    building games; and lots of other cool projects that tie into the engine, such as mods and
    TC's, and the research projects like Notre Dame.&nbsp; The community has a multiplicative
    effect on growing the platform.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Where we go from here</h4>

<p>When you look at the big picture, what's happening now with 3D graphics on the PC is
just the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp; In the past, we've been limited to the realm of
hardcore gamers, but now 3D acceleration is becoming much more mainstream, and 3D engines
are becoming recognized as a viable development tool for a wide range of projects. &nbsp;
The coming years will be interesting.</p>
