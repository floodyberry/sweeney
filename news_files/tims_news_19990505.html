<h4>Maps that broke since 220</h4>

<p>Some user maps such has <a
href="http://www.planetunreal.com/dl/dl.asp?nalicity/dmhellshrap.zip">DmHellShrap</a>
broke with version 224. This was caused by a little bug in the file
backwards-compatibility code, that I've fixed for 225.&nbsp; Map authors don't need to do
anything, this will automatically be fixed with 225.&nbsp; The specific problem I fixed
was an exit with an assertion:</p>

<pre>
    Assertion failed: Field [File:..\Inc\UnClass.h] [Line: 139]</pre>

<p>If there are any user maps which don't require .u file mods, and the maps refuse to
load with a <span class="italic">different</span> error message than this, please email the map (or a URL
where we can download the map) to <a href="mailto:unreal224@epicgames.com">unreal224@epicgames.com</a>.</p>

<h4>Quick Notes</h4>

<p>We've been going through the Unreal 224 bug reports and addressing lots of issues
people have pointed out.&nbsp; Here's the latest status. </p>


<ul>
  <li>Creative Labs EAX 3D sound support is fixed for 225.</li>
  <li>We're working with Aureal to get A3D 2.0 support into 225, which is very likely to
    happen.</li>
  <li>I fixed the cause of the &quot;out of memory&quot; errors that tended to happen when the
    console was pulled down on some machines. There was a problem in UnrealScript with switch
    statements operating on strings, which caused this and some similar problems reported by
    licensees.&nbsp; Thanks to Mark Poesch of <a href="http://www.wheeloftime.com">Legend</a> for tracking this one down.</li>

  <li>Under some conditions, alt-tabbing between fullscreen and windowed play would cause the
    in-a-window game window to be collapsed to zero size. Fixed.</li>
  <li>I optimized the network visibility code by about 25%.&nbsp; Server admins are reporting
    notably more CPU usage per player with 224 than 220.&nbsp; I haven't tracked this down,
    but I'm going through a lot of code to measure and improve the server performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many other fixes, tweaks, and incremental improvements are in the works. See the <a
