<h4>Important Unreal 224 Note To Mod Authors</h4>

<p>Unreal 224 .u files aren't backwards compatible with past versions of the engine.
&nbsp; So you'll need to take special steps to upgrade your .u files.</p>

<p>To upgrade mods to 224, you'll first need to export your scripts to *.uc files. &nbsp;
You can do this in all versions of UnrealEd like this: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Bring up the UnrealEd class browser on the right side of the screen.</li>

  <li>Click on the &quot;Load&quot; button and load your mod's .u file.</li>
  <li>Click on the &quot;Export All&quot; button and have UnrealEd export all of the loaded
    scripts to .uc files (including yours and the engine's), creating a directory structure
    for all the .uc files: for example, the files from the Core package are in
    \unreal\core\classes\*.uc.&nbsp; If your mod is named XYZ, your .uc files will be exported
    to \unreal\XYZ\classes\*.uc.</li>
</ol>

<p>In Unreal version 221 and earlier, you can rebuild your mod named &quot;XYZ&quot; from
the command line by typing:</p>

<pre>cd \unreal\system
del XYZ.u
unreal -make</pre>

<p>You can do that now, prior to the release of 224, to verify that your mod has been
safely exported and can be rebuilt from the command line.&nbsp; I highly recommend doing
this now, because if you install 224, you will no longer be able to load your old .u
files, so you'll have to downgrade back to 220 in order to export them.&nbsp; Some
developers prefer to edit scripts in UnrealEd, but many of us actually edit scripts in an
external editor (like Visual C++) and use the command-line interface for all production
work.</p>

<p>In Unreal 224, we have a new command-line compiler with a slighly different syntax:</p>

<pre>
cd \unreal\system
del XYZ.u
ucc make</pre>

<h4>Maps, Textures, Sounds, Music are backwards compatible</h4>

<p>...so there shouldn't be any problem with existing user maps built with past versions
of UnrealEd.&nbsp; I checked this by downloading a bunch of maps from <a
href="http://www.freshmeat.org/unreal/">Unreal Resources</a> and <a
href="http://www.planetunreal.com/nalicity/">Nali City</a> and testing
them.&nbsp; The one &quot;gotcha&quot; is that some user maps being distributed contain .u
files, and those aren't backwards compatible, so they will refuse to load until the .u
files they depend on are upgraded.</p>

<h4>Latest News</h4>

<p>I've been awake for way too long, so please forgive my spelling and grammar!</p>

<p>Internal testing of 224 continues.&nbsp; Things are looking pretty good, though we need
to go through a couple more iterations before everything's in perfect shape.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://avault.com/">Adrenaline Vault</a> has a good
article on the latest <a
href="http://avault.com/news/displaynews.asp?story=4141999-221754">Unreal
224 features</a>.&nbsp; They spill the beans on the major new feature I alluded to below:</p>

<blockquote><div>
  <p>Another major enhancement to be included in 224 is continuous
  level of detail,which varies polygon counts on objects such as player characters and
  power-ups relative to their distance from the camera, or player's perspective. In <i>Unreal
  Tournament</i>, this will enable the engine to place more characters and objects on the
  screen and still maintain a consistent and fluid framerate. Rein said this is an important
  feature not just for <i>Unreal</i> and <i>Unreal Tournament</i> but also for engine
  licensees since it also opens the engine to new game types, such as real-time strategy
  titles, that were not previously obvious choices for the engine.</p>

<h4>Cool Stuff</h4>

<p>While I wait for 200,000 lines of Unreal code to recompile, I wanted to point out some
more cool things that seem to be under-appreciated. </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.winamp.com/">WinAmp</a> is a great MP3 music player
    for Windows; and its companion, <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com/">ShoutCast</a>
    is a streaming &quot;Internet radio&quot; companion.&nbsp; While I know MP3's and Internet
    radio has been around for a while, WinAmp really deserves credit for its grassroots
    following and overall coolness factor.</li>

  <li>Windows 2000 internationalization support.&nbsp; This pure Unicode OS will mark the
    first time Microsoft ships a single binary worldwide, which will be a great leap forward
    in making it easy to develop games (and applications, and websites...) for the
    international market.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.plh.af.mil/ddvpc/melp.htm">MELP</a> 2400
    bits-per-second phone-quality voice compresion.&nbsp; Speech compression research has been
    making major leaps and bounds lately, as quality voice compression ratios skyrocket.
    &nbsp; The latest set of algorithms analyze an audio stream and (to simplify things a bit)
    transform it backwards to vocal cord excitation.&nbsp; The resulting compression ratio is
    in the neighborhood of 100-to-1.&nbsp; This is a research subject Carlo Vogelsang (Unreal
    sound engine programmer) and I have been looking into lately, and it turns out to be very
    complex and math intensive.</li>

</ul>
