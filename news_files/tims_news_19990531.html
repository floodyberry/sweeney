<ul>
  <li>4 out of 5 users have reported success with the experimental UnrealEd fix -- it made
    those nasty &quot;Runtime Error&quot; messages go away.&nbsp; If you're having problems
    with UnrealEd not starting up, grab this file!</li>

  <li>The other one reported an error message relating to Threed32.ocx which I fixed in <a
    href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Files/UnrealEdFix3.exe">UnrealEd Experimental Fix 3</a>.</li>
  <li>There was a master server outage/problem today.&nbsp; If you weren't seeing servers in
    Unreal's new server browser or GameSpy today, don't worry, the problem was at the master
    server and it has been fixed.</li>

<h4>Holiday?</h4>

<p>Here at Epic HQ, we suspect today is some type of holiday.&nbsp; The tell-tale sign is
that the parking lot was empty when we all came to work this morning.&nbsp; That usually
gives it away.&nbsp; However, we haven't figured out the identity of the occasion -- it
seems too warm outside for Easter, and our publisher isn't calling us three times a day
about shipping our game so it's probably not Christmas.</p>

<h4>New 225f Patch for server administrators only</h4>

<p>This should fix the UActorChannel::ReplicateActor crash and some smaller problems.

&nbsp; It's backwards-compatible with Unreal 224-225 clients.&nbsp; If you have any server
crashes, please email your Unreal.log file to <a href="mailto:unreal225@epicgames.com">unreal225@epicgames.com</a>.</p>

<p>Only download this if you are running an Unreal server: <a
href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Files/UnrealPatch225f.exe">UnrealPatch225f.exe</a>.</p>

<h4>Server 225e Patch Feedback</h4>

<p>Server admins are reporting much better performance, but 90% of the bug reports point
to a crash in UActorChannel::ReplicateActor.&nbsp; I've been fixing this (and a few other
things) and will have a new server-only patch later tonight.&nbsp; Thanks for everyone's
feedback!</p>

<h4>UnrealEd Experimental Fix 2</h4>

<p>Based on feedback, Saturday's experimental UnrealEd fix solved the problems for only
about 20% of users (wild guesstimate) who were previously unable to run UnrealEd.&nbsp; On
further investigation, we've found a set of Visual Basic runtime DLL's that are more
likely to work for most users.&nbsp; If UnrealEd still isn't working for you, please try <a
href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Files/UnrealEdFix2.exe">Experimental Fix 2</a>.&nbsp; Please let us know what
happens by emailing <a href="mailto:unreal225@epicgames.com">unreal225@epicgames.com</a> with a subject of &quot;Experimental Fix 2&quot;.&nbsp; </p>

<p>IMPORTANT: After installing the fix, reboot your machine before running UnrealEd.
&nbsp; The proper files won't be refreshed until you reboot.</p>

<p>Webmasters: Please only post this info on Unreal news sites.&nbsp; I don't want it to
go on general gaming sites until we have feedback on patch success/failure from users.</p>
