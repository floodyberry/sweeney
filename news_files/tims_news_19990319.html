<h4>Latest News</h4>

<p>We've been going through many iterations of internal testing and improvements on the
upcoming patch, which is now known as 223.&nbsp; Here is the latest <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/ReadMe223.htm">list of changes</a>.&nbsp; The story behind the version number is
that each time we make a new version for internal testing, we give it a new version letter
(for example, 221a, 221b).&nbsp; Between the previously released 220 patch and the current
one we're working on,&nbsp; we've gone through more than 52 internal versions.&nbsp; We've
beta-tested two release candidate patches, but each one has required more work.&nbsp; I
don't have a release date for this patch yet, but we're working hard to get it finished.</p>

<p>One unfortunate side-effect of the recent UnrealScript improvements (dynamic strings,
multi-skin support, other engine enhancements) is that 223 will have to break mod
compatibility with previous versions, and require at least a recompile (and code changes
in many cases).&nbsp; We hate breaking mods, because we understand how much pain it causes
for mod makers and the community to get back in synch with the latest version, but
sometimes it's a necessary evil, as a side-effect of progress.&nbsp; </p>

<p>One bonus we're putting into 223 to help compensate for the pain and suffering is Jack
&quot;Mek&quot; Porter's windowed GUI code, the high-level UnrealScript windowing
framework we're using for Unreal Tournament.&nbsp; This includes the graphical
&quot;server browser&quot; for finding good servers to play on -- sort of an in-game
GameSpy. The windowing code will give the community a chance to experiment with windowing
well before Unreal Tournament ships.</p>

<h4>Level-Of-Detail Texture Mapping</h4>

<p>I finally got the chance to write a rendering optimization I've been thinking about for
a long time now, level-of-detail texture mapping.</p>

<p>Unreal's biggest performance problem in OpenGL has been texture management overhead,
which causes frame rates to vary a lot (for example, jumping from 30+ fps down to 15 fps
for a frame or two when new textures come into view).&nbsp; This is especially noticeable
on on the Riva TNT, which has a very good fill rate and can handle large polygon counts,
but is around 4X slower transferring textures to the card than Voodoo2.</p>

<p>Solution: I create redundant versions of textures, scaled down 4X (in memory usage),
16X, 64X, and 256X. When an object being rendered is far away, I use a lower resolution
version of the texture -- which doesn't cause visual problems (since the texture would be
mipmapped anyway) but requires less texture data to be transferred.</p>

<p>This has enabled us to boost the Unreal Tournament player models' texture usage to 256K
of texels per model.&nbsp; More info about additional level-of-detail features later...</p>

<h4>Future of Programming Languages</h4>

<p>Lately, I've been doing research on programming languages, in the interest of gaining
new ideas to implement in the successor to UnrealScript for our next-generation (after
Unreal Tournament) engine.&nbsp; Some of the topics I've been formulating are: </p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Garbage collection (see the <a href="http://www.iecc.com/gclist/GC-faq.html">GC FAQ</a> for background).&nbsp; UnrealScript uses a simple recursive
    mark-and-sweep garbage collector which is only executed when changing levels, along with
    some special-case code to garbage-collect destroyed actors during gameplay.&nbsp; Most
    implementations of Java use a background thread to run a generational garbage collector.
    &nbsp; Java's approach is more general, but can cause pauses during execution as large
    amounts of garbage are purged, which is bad for frame-rate consistency.</p>

    <p>Java garbage collection presents a problem for object finalizers (the equivalent of C++
    destructors), because the finalizer is executed at some random time after the object in
    question effectively becomes garbage, and finalizers of multiple objects are executed in
    random order.&nbsp; This limitation makes finalizers dangerous and not terribly useful.
    &nbsp; One work-around is to not support finalizers.&nbsp; Another work-around is to
    support them, but publish a list of &quot;things that aren't safe to do from within a
    finalizer&quot; (such as cause finalized objects to become rooted again, make assumptions
    about finalization order, etc).&nbsp; UnrealScript's current solution is a mix of the two;
    finalizers must be native (implemented in C++) and are subject to those safety guidelines.</p>
    

    <p>Another general conceptual problem I have with garbage collection is that, often, the
    physical lifetime of an object (as defined by the garbage collector) often exceeds the
    &quot;practical&quot; lifetime of an object (as defined by the semantics of the program
    you're writing).&nbsp; For example, a window object in a windowing system is only
    meaningful when the window is open on screen; after the window has been closed, the object
    becomes meaningless even though it still exists and other objects might still be referring
    to the window.&nbsp; The general problem is that programmers often would like a &quot;way
    of explicitly destroying an object and removing any other objects' references to it&quot;.
    &nbsp; C and C++ avoid this problem by making all memory management the program's
    responsibility.&nbsp; Java avoids it by making the program responsible for determening
    whether an object you're referring to is meaningful (for example by calling
    Window.IsOpen()).&nbsp; It would certainly be nice if object lifetime management and
    notifications became the full responsibility of the programming language, enabling
    programmers to instead focus on higher-level problems.</p>

    <p>The garbage-collection strategy that would be ideal, from the standpoint of predictable
    code and memory usage, is to finalize and destroy objects the exact moment they become
    garbage, i.e. when the last variable still referencing it changes.&nbsp; I've tried, very
    unsuccessfully, to find efficient approaches to manage such as system by tracking multiple
    reference counts, doubly-linked lists of two-way references between objects, etc etc etc,
    and haven't been able to find an approach more efficient that performing a brute-force
    mark-and-sweep pass every time a reference to an object changes (plus optimizations such
    as reference counting to collect objects without cyclic references).&nbsp; Stated in graph
    theory, the question boils down to &quot;Given a graph and a particular directed edge of
    the graph, does removing that edge break the graph into two disjoint pieces?&quot; &nbsp;
    Does anybody know if there is a graph-theory algorithm for determining this, which enables
    you to add a directed edge to the graph in constant time, and also remove an edge and
    determine disjointedness from that removal in constant time?</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>LISP defines a new kind of object called a &quot;function closure&quot; which basically
    represents a pointer-to-a-member-function with several of its parameters bound to specific
    values (for example, binding the implicit &quot;Self&quot;/&quot;this&quot; parameter to a
    particular object.&nbsp; This is a great object-oriented generalization of
    function-pointers, but the syntax becomes fairly complex in a statically-typed language
    (some issues you run into are recursively-defined closure types, and cyclic closure
    types).&nbsp; Microsoft's Java extensions in Visual J++ include a simpler and more limited
    type of object called a &quot;delegate&quot; which is a pointer-to-a-member-function bound
    to a specific instance of an object.&nbsp; I plan to experiment with these possibilities
    and implement &quot;something along these lines&quot; in the next engine.</p>

  </li>
  <li><p>Inner classes, as defined by Java, are a great feature for attaching objects together
    hierarchically.&nbsp; This is definitely a feature I want for the future.&nbsp; One
    example area where inner would simplify and generalize the code is Unreal's actor lighting
    support.&nbsp; Currently, the Actor class has a bunch of variables related to lighting
    (LightBrightness, LightHue, LightSaturation, LightEffect, etc), and an enumeration
    LightType that describes the light's overall mode of operation.&nbsp; While this is an
    improvement over past engines, and general enough for 1998-1999 games, it could be much
    better.&nbsp; Actors could instead reference a separate Light object which describes the
    lighting in a more general way.&nbsp; Instead of having a hardcoded enumeration for light
    effects (such as LE_TorchWaver, LE_Cylinder, LE_Spotlight), all the different light types
    could be represented by separate classes (TorchWaverLight, CylinderLight, SpotLight) with
    the class supplying the appropriate spatial and volumetric lighting math. &nbsp;</p>

    <p>Additionally, the lighting objects could be made hierarchical, so you could modulate a
    cylinder light by a spotlight, and add a torch wavering effect on top. &nbsp; New light
    classes could be defined modularly to supply new lighting functions without modifying the
    engine source.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>While my plan for the next scripting language is gaining more clarity, there are still
a lot of wide-open issues.&nbsp; For example, whether Java-style interfaces are necessary
(since most of the same functionality can be obtained from inner classes), what the final
garbage-collection strategy is, how similar do we want to make the language to Java, etc.</p>

<h4>Visible Surface Determination</h4>

<p>One of the biggest next-generation challenges for 3D programmers will be in solving the
&quot;visible surface determination&quot; problem for complex scenes.&nbsp; Doom basically
used a densely portalized BSP scheme; Quake used a BSP in conjunction with precomputing
the visibility from each BSP leaf in the world to every other leaf, trading off
precomputation time in exchange for rendering performance. Unreal uses a sparsely
portalized BSP tree and performs a software span-buffering pass to determine which
polygons are visible prior to actually rendering them.&nbsp; None of these approaches are
clearly superior to the others; they each have strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; Unreal's
tradeoff enables us to render more complex multi-pass surfaces (very high-res textures,
detail textures, light maps, and fog maps) but limits our polygon counts, since rendering
performance grows approximately as &quot;n log n&quot; with polygon counts, compared to
Quake's basically linear &quot;n&quot; scaling. </p>

<p>The visuals of Unreal Tournament vs. Quake 3 Arena will provide a very useful
equal-footing comparison between the two techniques, with id Software is pushing the
limits of polygon counts, and us pushing the limits of texture detail.</p>

<p>After this generation of games, I think we'll all have to fundamentally change the way
we approach the visibility problem.&nbsp; As 3D worlds grow larger, more seamlessly
interconnected, and more vibrant in terms of dynamic and procedural geometry, we'll need
more of a no-tradeoffs approach than precomputed visibility or BSP's.&nbsp; Portal and
anti-portal clipping schemes look promising.&nbsp; Hardware-assisted visibility tests
(such as HP's <a href="http://www.opengl.org/Documentation/Version1.2/HPspecs/occlusion_test.txt">OpenGL occlusion test extension</a>) look promising.&nbsp; Even the good
old DFE scheme becomes more practical with increased 3D hardware performance.&nbsp; After
Unreal Tournament, I'll be experimenting again with all of these techniques.</p>

<h4>Commentary on Cool Stuff</h4>

<p>I just wanted to point out the following cool technical things. </p>

<ul>
  <li>OpenGL <a
    href="http://www.opengl.org/Documentation/Version1.2/EXTspecs/fragment_lighting.txt">Fragment Lighting</a> and <a
    href="http://www.opengl.org/Documentation/Version1.2/EXTspecs/light_texture.txt">Light Texture</a> extensions.&nbsp; These exceedingly clear, general, and
    well thought-out rendering capabilities are going to be the next quantum leap in 3D
    hardware acceleration acceleration, enabling true Phong/Blinn bump mapping and a
    tremendous variety of other features.&nbsp; My reaction to seeing this spec for the first
    time is reminiscent of first experiencing 3dfx's Voodoo accelerator and the Glide
    API--it's &quot;I can't believe how powerful yet simple this is to work with&quot;.</li>

  <li><a href="http://teach.belmont.edu/ht/applet/htbu.html">Hyperbolic Tree
    Controls</a>: This is the first generally useful new GUI control I've seen in years.
    Imagine the possibilities for using hyperbolic trees to browse the actor lists and server
    interconnectivity of huge interconnected online worlds.</li>
