<h4>TNT Users, Try This!</h4>

<p>Tweaks: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Play in 16-bit color, which is significantly faster than 32-bit color.</li>

  <li>Turn the detail options down in the Preferences/Video menu.</li>
  <li>Use the &quot;-&quot; key to reduce the HUD size.</li>
  <li>In Preferences/Game, turn off the display of your weapon.</li>
  <li>If you have enabled Advanced Options / Audio / Use3DHardware audio support, TURN IT OFF
    for now! Big driver performance problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>Experimental improvement for the brave: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Try <a href="http://www.geforce-fr.com/drivers/win9x_nv3.34.exe">NVidia's
    Beta Detonator 3.34 drivers</a> (thanks to <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/">Anandtech's</a> site for the link).</li>
  <li>Try putting this new <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/D3DDRV.DLL">D3DDRV.DLL</a> into your \TournamentDemo\System directory. Please back up your existing one first!</li>

</ul>

<p>These two downloads are beta and haven't been rigorously tested yet, but in our
gameplay sessions here, they're a huge improvement on low-RAM machines with the TNT, TNT2,
and GeForce256.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please let us know how these work for you, by emailing <a

<h4>Latest Findings</h4>

<p>We've been benchmarking UT performance and memory usage on many 3D cards, and we've
found the source of the performance problems on 64-96 meg machines with TNT/TNT2 cards.</p>

<p>Our measurements indicate that the TNT/TNT2 drivers consume up to 25 megabytes of
page-locked system memory with UT, while other Direct3D cards don't.&nbsp; On machines
with 64-96 megs, that kills performance, as one would expect.&nbsp; The game runs, but
data is swapped to the hard drive so frequently that playability is
compromised.&nbsp;&nbsp; We've been comparing with other 3D cards and aren't seeing the
issue on the Rage 128 or Voodoo3 under Direct3D.</p>

<p>System-wide memory allocations measured with SYSMON.EXE on a 64-meg Celeron running
Windows 98 SE: </p>

<ul>
  <li>TNT D3D: 51 MB baseline, 122 MB playing UT in 16-bit color, 134 MB playing UT in 32-bit
    color.</li>
  <li>Rage 128 D3D: 55 MB baseline, 107 MB playing UT in 16-bit color, 109 MB playing UT in
    32-bit color.</li>
  <li>Voodoo3 D3D: 51 MB baseline, 100 MB playing UT in 16-bit color.</li>
</ul>

<p>We're working with the NVidia guys to track down the source of the extra 25 megabytes
of memory consumption.&nbsp; I'm going to hold off on posting our benchmarks till we've
had a good chance to deal with the memory consumption issue, so everyone is on a level
playing field.&nbsp;&nbsp; The NVidia cards already perform well on PC's with lots of RAM,
so they should be in good shape once the memory issues are solved.</p>
