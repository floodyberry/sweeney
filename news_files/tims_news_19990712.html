<h4>New Downloads &amp; Links Pages</h4>

<p>By popular request, the links on the tech page have been updated and cleaned up. &nbsp;
I added: </p>

<ul>
  <li><p>New <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Downloads.htm">Unreal Downloads</a> page: An index of all the official
    files here on the tech page, plus links to dedicated Unreal download sites.&nbsp; If
    you're looking for the latest PC or Mac patch, UnrealEd patch, Fusion maps, or whatever,
    look here.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>New <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Links.htm">Unreal Links</a> page. Links to some of the major
    &quot;hub&quot; web sites related to the Unreal community, Epic, our partners.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I also wanted to mention the supercool new download site, <a
href="http://www.unrealfiles.com/">Unrealfiles.com</a>, check it out.</p>
