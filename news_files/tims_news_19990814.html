<h4>DirectX7</h4>

<p>Some people have been asking about our plans for supporting the upcoming
DirectX7.&nbsp; Unreal Tournament will ship with DirectX6 support, and will be compatible
with (but not optimized for) DirectX7.&nbsp; As soon as Microsoft has released DirectX7
and we've had a chance to optimize the code for DX7 and test it across a wide range of
cards, we'll release an Unreal Tournament patch with complete DirectX7
optimizations.&nbsp; This has been the plan all along.</p>

<p>DirectX7 has lots of cool new features.&nbsp; The ones which Unreal Tournament will
exploit are: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Improved texture management.</li>
  <li>Hooks to enable 3D card drivers to perform their own texture management to improve
    performance.</li>
  <li>Optimized polygon path for significantly faster polygon rates.</li>
  <li>Windows 2000 support.</li>

</ul>
