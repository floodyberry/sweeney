<h4>Latest News</h4>

<p>Progress on Unreal 221 and Unreal Tournament continues.&nbsp; We are making changes and
improvements at such a fast pace that it has been hard/impossible to stabilize the code
for the 3-5 days required to fully test a new patch.&nbsp; I apologize for the earlier
false start we had with 221.</p>

<h4>What we've been programming</h4>

<p>I've been juggling work on the installer, OpenGL, and some core UnrealScript
improvements.&nbsp; The installer is coming together, and is complete in terms of
installing the retail game and patches, but more work remains to be done on uninstallation
issues, and improved support for installing/distributing mods.&nbsp; Some of the latest
UnrealScript improvements include a command-line script compiler, which can be used from
any programmer's editor (or Visual C++) with standard output of error messages;
UnrealScript execution optimizations; and support for dynamic strings.</p>

<p>UnrealScript's string support has been pretty solid all along, as a result of using
BASIC style functions (Left, Right, Mid, InStr, Chr, Asc...) instead of C's error-prone
string handling functions (strcpy, strcat, strcmp, sprintf).&nbsp; The one annoying
limitation, which has been the source of some bugs in the past, is that strings were fixed
length.&nbsp; 221 supports dynamically sized strings with no practical size limitation
(just available memory).&nbsp; This makes it easier to write text-processing routines,
which the new in-game server browser is really stressing.</p>

<p>Steve Polge has been improving the AI and the flexibility of the game code. &nbsp;
Because Unreal Tournament's gameplay can be far more complex than Unreal 1's (from a bot's
perspective) as a result of team play and Capture The Flag, Steve has been teaching the
bots a lot of new techniques for coordinating together and better understanding the
environments.&nbsp; It's sooo cool watching Cliff and Myscha playing CTF with a few bots
on their teams.</p>

<p>Jack Porter is hammering away on the new user interface code and the in-game server
browser.&nbsp; In the past, first-person action games haven't been known for having good
user interfaces.&nbsp; We're hoping to change that, and go for the quality level of an EA
Sports interface.&nbsp; Sticking to our general-purpose roots, Jack isn't just creating
user-interface code for Unreal Tournament, he's creating a flexible, object-oriented UI
framework which will be very suitable for licensees and mod makers.</p>

<p>Brandon Reinhart is working hard, implementing a lot of the Unreal Tournament game
code, the single-player progression, stats tracking, and much more.&nbsp; The stats
tracking is going to be a very cool feature for Internet play; perhaps I can convince
Brandon to write a note about it here.</p>

<p>Erik de Neve, who created Unreal's algorithmic fire and water effects and optimized
much of the rendering code, is working on a next-generation project that will make its
debut in Unreal 2.</p>

<h4>Linux Notes</h4>

<p>We now have a command-line (windowless, console based) script compiler and server for
Unreal, which has minimal dependencies on Windows.&nbsp; This is a first step towards a
Linux port, and it also runs very well under Wine, with minimal overhead.&nbsp; This might
be a good interim solution for Linux server administrators, before the full port is done.
&nbsp; I just noticed in GameSpy that the top server on the list is titled &quot;CHiX
Unreal NT Server (220) PORT UNREAL TO LINUX&quot;.&nbsp; Hint taken. :)</p>

<p>We actually have the Unreal 221 Core source compiling under EGCS 2.90.29, C++ templates
and all.&nbsp; Getting the thing linking and running successfully will require a lot more
work, which we won't be able to focus on until UT ships, but the experience thus far has
been very positive.</p>
