<h4>Hard at work</h4>

<p>We're hard at work putting the finishing touches on Unreal 220.&nbsp; It's looking
good, but the extent of the changes and improvements has required quite a lot of testing
and refinement.&nbsp; It won't be ready for public consumption this week or over the
weekend, but hopefully early next week.</p>

<p>A lot of mod authors have emailed asking for early access to Unreal 220 so they can get
their stuff is up and running in the new version.&nbsp; The answer right now is
&quot;maybe&quot;...if the code comes together over the weekend, I'll post a public
&quot;for mod authors only&quot; version.&nbsp; 220 will break compatibility with most
UnrealScript mods, but I've modified UnrealEd so that mods can still be loaded (this is a
change: 219's UnrealEd gives a fatal error when loading an incompatible .u file). &nbsp;

Upgrading most mods will be easy; the most significant changes are function parameter
changes all over the place, and splitting off the network-related variables in Pawn into a
new PlayerReplicationInfo class, to make scoreboard-programming simpler and more
expandable.&nbsp; In terms of mod support, the week following 220's release will be
chaotic, with mods being repaired and re-released.&nbsp; Sorry, we would have liked to
avoid this, but the improvements we wanted to make were just too cool to stick with full
backwards-compatibility.</p>

<p>Levels, sounds, texture files, music files, and audio files remain
backwards-compatible.</p>

<p>Shortly after 220, I'll be releasing the C++ headers required for users to write C++
add-ons.&nbsp; I'm planning on throwing together a very simple SampleTexture package
showing how to make algorithmic textures, and a SampleActor package showing how to write
intrinsic C++ functions for actors.&nbsp; This stuff should give mod authors a very
significant amount of new stuff to play with, though the more exciting C++ stuff will come
in a later release with the UnrealEd plug-in interface.&nbsp; It will be interesting to
see the response to the C++ headers, because the Unreal engine's C++ architecture is very,
very different than what people are used to in Quake and other engines.&nbsp; It's very
much a framework rather than an API.</p>

<p>Jack &quot;Mek&quot; Porter has come here from Australia for a few months to help with
the Unreal Tournament programming, and is currently working on some cool new mouse-based
user interface code.&nbsp; He is a big Linux fan, and is talking with Brandon Reinhart
about cooperating on a native Linux port of the Unreal server.</p>

<h4>That's UnrealEd.net</h4>

<p>The cool independent Unreal editing site I mentioned is actually <a
