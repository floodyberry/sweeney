<h4>Unreal 221 Development Update</h4>

<p>Unreal 221 development continues, with quite a lot of new features slipping into this
version.</p>

<p>Right now, Mark Poesch (the lead programmer of Wheel of Time) is visiting us here in
Raleigh, merging in some of the improvements the Legend team has added into the Unreal
engine for WoT and Legend's upcoming Unreal level pack.</p>

<p>I'm working on Unreal's OpenGL support, and will soon get a version of the code to the
3D hardware makers who have some driver issues to work out.&nbsp; The Riva TNT is
currently the fastest and most stable card, with the ATI Rage 128 looking very promising,
especially in 24-bit color.</p>

<p>I'm also extending the Unreal installer which shipped with the 220 patch, turning it
into a full-blown installation program for future patches, shareware versions, and retail
versions.&nbsp; I'm also contemplating extending it to support Unreal mods, which could
then be distributed in a self-contained format (.uzip?) which Unreal automatically knows
how to install.&nbsp; This would put cool mods just 3-4 mouse clicks away from users who
are browsing mod sites like <a href="http://www.freshmeat.org/unreal/">Unreal
Resources</a>, a great improvement over the current process of &quot;download a file, run
PkZip, extract the .utx files to the Unreal\Textures directory, extract the .unr files to
the Unreal\Maps directory, run Unreal, then try to figure out how to launch the mod&quot;.
&nbsp; This has the potential to bring mods to a much wider audience.</p>

<p>While I don't enjoy the painful and redundant task of writing an install program, I see
it as worthwhile because it's such a critical piece of a game--especially one which is
supported by an online community and third-party licensees.</p>

<h4>Unreal Tournament</h4>

<p>The rest of the team is hard at work on Unreal Tournament, and we're really happy with
the way the game is shaping up.&nbsp; Unreal was such a huge, multi-faceted project that
we weren't able to focus on deathmatch as much as we would have liked.&nbsp; Unreal
Tournament, with its identical gameplay style between single-player and multiplayer (the
only difference being bots vs. human opponents) has given us a far more opportunity to
polish the gameplay and the look-and-feel.</p>
