<h4>STAT NET: Diagnosing your connection to the server</h4>

<p>When playing a multiplayer game of Unreal, press TAB and type STAT NET to bring up the
network stats display.&nbsp; You'll see something like this:</p>

<pre>(IN/OUT):
   137         PING
    38         CHANNELS
     0       0 UNORDERED/SEC
   12%     14% PACKET LOSS
    11      32 PACKETS/SEC
   126      32 BUNCHES/SEC
  1395    2031 BYTES/SEC
  2600    2600 NETSPEED</pre>

<p>The numbers on the left represent incoming statistics (for example, how many packets
from the server to you were lost), and the right outgoing statistics (for example, how
many packets from you to the server were lost).&nbsp; There interesting stats are:</p> 


<ul>
  <li>PING: Round-trip time between you and the server, in milliseconds.&nbsp; Modem users
    will typically see 200-350 for in-country gameplay.&nbsp; ISDN/T1 users will be in the
    50-200 range.&nbsp; Playing overseas results in enormous times, 600-1000 or more. &nbsp;
    This number represents the quality of the connection between you and the server, and
    really should be 300 or less for good gameplay performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bad
    connection on either end can hurt the ping time.</li>
  <li>CHANNELS: Roughly, the number of objects that the server is actively updating to you.
    &nbsp; Proportional to how much combat is happening around you.</li>

  <li>PACKET LOSS: Percentage of packets lost between the client and server.&nbsp; The higher
    the packet loss, the worse the performance will be, and the more you'll see objects
    skipping around rather than moving smoothly.&nbsp; High packet loss can be caused by:
    <ul>
      <li>Using too aggressive a network speed on the client side.&nbsp; Try typing &quot;NETSPEED
        2600&quot; on the console to reign in bandwidth usage.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>The server's connection is overtaxed.&nbsp; This will result in heavy packet loss and a
        bad gameplay experience for everyone.&nbsp; Servers will limited bandwidth available need
        to set their play limit conservative (expect 5000 bytes per client per second), and also
        lower the MaxClientRate variable in Unreal.ini.&nbsp; A value of 5000 should be good for
        everyone.</li>

      <li>A bad connection anywhere between you and the server.</li>
      <li>A bad connection between you and your ISP.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>PACKETS/SEC: Number of packets being sent per second.&nbsp; The number on the left
    should be 13 or higher.&nbsp; If it's significantly less, that means the server is either
    running too slowly, or experiencing high packet loss.&nbsp; Gameplay will be bad at 10,
    and unbearable at 5.&nbsp; The number on the right is proportional to your frame rate and
    you don't need to worry about it.</li>

  <li>BUNCHES/SEC: Number of objects being updated per second.&nbsp; Not important for
    tweaking.</li>
  <li>BYTES/SEC: Bytes being sent per second.</li>
  <li>NETSPEED: The network speed setting you set using the console NETSPEED command. &nbsp;
    Recommended settings are:
    <ul>
      <li>2600 for a typical modem connection.</li>

      <li>2400 for a poor modem connection.</li>
      <li>5000 for an ISDN connection.</li>
      <li>20000 for a T1 connection.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Server Alert</h4>

<p>Unreal 224 servers are popping up very rapidly, and becoming filled to capacity rather
quickly.&nbsp; From the last couple hours of cruising the net and playing on various
servers, we're seeing wildly varying performance.&nbsp; As with all games, the quality of
Unreal netplay is a function of how well the server is performing and how good your
connection is (bandwidth, packet loss, and latency).</p>

<p>If you're having a bad experience, please try out a few other servers.&nbsp; This can
affect performance hugely.&nbsp; In my game sessions here, I had some great performance
with a 300 msec ping and 28.8Kbps bandwidth, and some astronomically bad performance with
a 100 ping and 50Kbps bandwidth.&nbsp; The bad performance fell into two categories.</p>

<p>Some servers have more users than bandwidth available, so they are dropping packets,
experiencing 50%+ packet loss and escalating ping.&nbsp; Some are just running very
slowly, around 5 fps (I'm not sure why, perhaps other processes were running?).&nbsp; This
tends to happen whenever we release a patch, as people rush to get into gameplay, flooding
the servers that have upgraded, users setting up servers on cable modems out of
desperation to get into a game... It can get chaotic.&nbsp; In the future, the new
backwards-compatible network code should mean there are always lots of servers available
when a patch is released.</p>

<p>So, bottom line:&nbsp; Please don't bitch if netplay performance is erratic over the
next couple days as servers get set up and stabilized.&nbsp; If netplay performance sucks
after a couple of days, THEN commence bitching. :-)</p>

<h4>Unreal 224v C++ headers released!</h4>

<p>For hardcore mod authors who want to experiment with Unreal's C++ interface, here it
is!&nbsp; This code requires Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 with no service packs or SP1. &nbsp;
Read the <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/ReadMeSrc.htm">Public Source ReadMe</a> for more information and
distribution terms.</p>

<p>Now it's time for a disclaimer about the C++ code.&nbsp; For mod authors, UnrealScript
is the best way to write game code.&nbsp; The fact that 100% of the Unreal 1 and Unreal
Tournament game-specific code is in UnrealScript illustrates our strategy here, that
UnrealScript is a fully-featured language designed to simplify game programming compared
to C++.&nbsp; The C++ code is significantly more complex than UnrealScript, and is only
necessary for programming things that just aren't possible under UnrealScript, such as
algorithmic textures,&nbsp; performance-critical AI decision making,&nbsp; and that kind
of low-level work.&nbsp; Furthermore, our distributing just the headers (and not the C++
engine source), means that many key aspects of the engine are hidden in implementation
details, so it's going to be hard to understand what's happening &quot;under the
hood&quot;.&nbsp; Another major downside to C++ is that C++ mods will break with almost
every upcoming patch, whereas UnrealScript is more stable (having broken only 3 times in
11 months and approximately 12 public betas released).&nbsp; Summary: This C++ code is for
very, very hardcore mod makers only.</p>

<p>That said, there is some cool stuff here.&nbsp; I've included all of the core and
engine header files and .lib link libraries in this release, so you can compile your own
DLL's and link them to Unreal.&nbsp; I've also included the C++ code for some modules
which we don't feel are confidential: Unreal's OpenGL support layer (OpenGLDrv), the
engine startup code (Launch), and the installer/uninstaller (Setup).</p>

<p>The OpenGL code will be of interest to OpenGL driver writers who want to see what we do
in Unreal, in order to optimize their drivers, and possible to enthusiasts who want to
experiment with rendering.</p>

<p>We will probably be able to publically release the Direct3D driver code soon too, also
to aid driver writers and experimenters, but our Direct3D development partner is going to
first spend some time cleaning up that code.</p>

<p>This code is provided as-is: we don't have much time for answering everyone's questions
about it, so you're mostly on your own.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/UnrealPubSrc224v.zip">C++ code can be downloaded here</a>. Unzip it into
your \Unreal directory, and the proper subdirectories will be created (described in the <a
href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/ReadMeSrc.htm">ReadMe</a>).&nbsp; The C++ code compiles there and links to DLL's in
the \Unreal\System directory, read to run.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p>
