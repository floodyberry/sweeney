<h4>Linux Unreal</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.linuxgames.com/">Linux Games</a> has reported a way to run the
existing version of Unreal under Linux, using the <span class="italic">Wine</span> Windows emulator for
Linux.&nbsp; They've included a screenshot and more information at this <a

<h4>Hired Guns</h4>

<p>Want to see something cool and unique that's being done with the Unreal engine?
&nbsp;&nbsp; Check out the <a

preview.&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.devilsthumb.com/">Devil's Thumb</a>
team is really pushing the engine, and has implemented a beautiful user-interface design
featuring multiple game windows. I look forward to playing this game. (Thanks <a
