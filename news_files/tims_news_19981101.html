<h4>Unreal Grows...</h4>

<p>More public servers keep popping up every day.&nbsp; Awesome! </p>

<p>I noticed that the percentage of servers shown as &quot;not responding&quot; has gone
up, though I'm not sure whether that's due to server crashes, or people accidentally
having their LAN server listed in GameSpy when it's not meant to be public.&nbsp; Server
admins, if your server crashes unexpectedly, please email your Unreal.log file to <a
href="mailto:unreal218@epicgames.com">unreal218@epicgames.com</a> so we can investigate
it.</p>

<p>A reminder, server administrators can get help in the new &quot;Server
Administration&quot; forum on the <a href="http://megaboard.epicgames.com/">Epic Message Board</a>.</p>

<p>According to the feedback we receive, and in <a href="http://www.planetunreal.com/">PlanetUnreal</a>'s survey, 218 has fixed the past network problems and
made Unreal playable on the Internet for the large majority of people.&nbsp; Still, we
have lots of improvements in the works, which will further increase the game's smoothness
and responsiveness during network play, as well as a few new features that I'm not allowed
to announce yet. :)&nbsp; The next patch, 219, will be purely bug fixes to 218 (no speed
difference).&nbsp; After that, 220 will contain some more high-level improvements to many
areas of the network code.</p>

<p>Currently, there seem to be two sets of people who are still having some problems with
Unreal on the Internet.&nbsp; One set has 28.8K-33.6K modem connections that experience an
unusally&nbsp; high amount of packet loss.&nbsp; 220 should improve this a bit, but when
you have upwards of 20% packet loss, gameplay is bound to suffer.&nbsp; The other set of
problems is being reported by people with some unusual connections we haven't been able to
test on internally: people with dual simultaneous modem connections, people with
connections that receive via satellite and send via modem, and some similar
configurations.&nbsp; I haven't determined what's going wrong in these cases yet, but I
suspect packet-order problems.</p>
