<p>9 out of 10 doctors say now would be a good time to prune the Unreal tech
page, and that sounds like a good idea to me. I'd like to start over by talking
about a bunch of things I've been meaning to cover, but never found the time.</p>
<h4>Common Questions I'm Asked</h4>
<p><span class="strong">Q</span>. I'm an aspiring game developer and I want to get into the
business.&nbsp; What's the best way to be hired?</p>

<p><span class="strong">A</span>. The single most important thing game companies will look for is past
experience: what cool stuff you have worked on previously.&nbsp; This might
sound like a Catch-22: &quot;You need experience to get a job, and you need a
job to get experience&quot;.&nbsp; But nowadays, the mod communities around
leading games like Half-Life, Unreal Tournament, and Quake 3 Arena are great
proving grounds where aspiring game developers can work on projects freely
(mostly in their spare time), and build levels, mods, and other game-play
enhancements.&nbsp; In the past few years, the majority of new talent Epic has
hired have been people from the Unreal and Quake communities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Steve Polge, creator of the ReaperBot mod for Quake.</li>
  <li>Brandon &quot;GreenMarine&quot; Reinhart, early Unreal mod maker and
    writer of cool UnrealScript programming tutorials.</li>

  <li>Jack &quot;mek&quot; Porter, Unreal mod maker and PlanetUnreal news
    correspondent.</li>
  <li>Alan Willard, maker of cool Unreal and Quake levels.</li>
  <li>Shane Caudle, amazing artist and level designer who was building his own
    Quake TC.</li>
</ul>
<p>While past work on cool projects is the number one criteria for most game
developers, having a University degree is a major advantage.&nbsp; While this
isn't a must at Epic, most larger game developers place more emphasis on having
a degree.&nbsp; Besides that, college is a great opportunity to <i>learn useful
stuff</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; My degree is in Mechanical Engineering (University of
Maryland) -- by the time I was in college, I had been programming for about 10
years and didn't feel getting a computer science degree would be
challenging.&nbsp; So, I chose engineering, and that turned out to be a major
challenge, and incredibly valuable.</p>

<p>The math I learned there, including vector calculus and finite element
analysis, which are directly applicable to 3D games, is something I never would
have studied independently.&nbsp; Self-taught programmers pick up algorithms
just by looking at other code and reading the occasional book (that's how I
learned to program).&nbsp;&nbsp; But differential equations are just not the
kind of thing you're likely to rediscover on your own, though understanding them
brings clarity to lots of real-world problems you'll encounter.</p>
<p><span class="strong">Q</span>. What do I need to get started making mods for popular games?</p>

<p><span class="strong">A</span>. Just a copy of the game, the editing and compiling tools, and access
to the web sites that contain information for mod authors.&nbsp; For <a href="http://www.unrealtournament.com/">Unreal
Tournament</a>, you just need a copy of UT, which includes the editor (on CD#2)
and all the <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/unrealscript.htm">UnrealScript</a> code for the entire
game; visit the Unreal community web sites (listed at the top of this page) for
tons of pointers to Unreal information.&nbsp; For <a href="http://www.idsoftware.com/">Quake
3 Arena</a>, you need the retail game and the utilities; visit <a href="http://www.planetquake.com/">PlanetQuake</a>

to get started.&nbsp; For <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/">Half-Life</a>,
get the game and see <a href="http://www.planethalflife.com/">PlanetHalfLife</a>
for tips.</p>
<p><span class="strong">Q</span>. I'm working on a project; do I need to license the Unreal
Tournament engine or sign any paperwork?</p>
<p><span class="strong">A</span>. That depends on what you're doing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you are making a freely available mod, all you need is the retail
    version of the game.</li>

  <li>If you are using the engine for non-commercial academic purposes, all you
    need is the retail game.&nbsp; Lots of people have been using the Unreal
    Tournament engine as part of university projects and theses.</li>
  <li>If you are a startup game developer and are prototyping a game in the
    Unreal Tournament engine (using the tools available in the retail version),
    you don't need a license agreement while you're prototyping the game. You do
    need a license agreement in place before you advertise a game, sign a
    publishing agreement, or otherwise profit from the game.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Programming Languages</h4>
<p>Ever since my <a href="http://www.gamespy.com">GameSpy</a>
Developer Week article, &quot;<a href="http://www.gamespy.com/articles/devweek_b.shtm">A
Critical Look At Programming Languages</a>&quot;, I've been getting questions
about whether we plan to &quot;do something about it&quot; and define a new
programming language.&nbsp; The answer is, we're already doing that to a certain
extent with <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/unrealscript.htm">UnrealScript</a>, which is a high-level,
object-oriented, platform-independent language with some cool extensions aimed
at game code development.</p>

<p>As an engine developer, we'll always be involved in language design to a
certain extent.&nbsp; In the future, the scripting language could evolve into a
simpler form, more true to the &quot;scripting&quot; term: controlling sequences
of in-game events.&nbsp; Or, the scripting language could grow to subsume even
more of the engine code.&nbsp; We'll be evaluating these options anew with each
major iteration of the engine, doing whatever is most appropriate for the
technology, recognizing the benefits and drawbacks of going with well-known
proven tech, versus creating newer, better tech.</p>
<h4>Also...</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The cool soon-to-be-public site <a href="http://www.linuxnewbie.com/">Linux
    Newbie</a> already has posted a <a href="http://www.linuxnewbie.org/nhf/intel/games/unreal_tourney.html">cool
    article</a> on how to get started with Unreal Tournament under Linux.&nbsp;

    This site is a great idea; the biggest barrier to widespread Linux adoption
    right now is the difficulty of getting started, and now in standard
    decentralized Linux fashion, sites and resources are starting to pop up to
    address this.</li>
