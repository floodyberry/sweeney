<h4>UnrealEd Follow-Up</h4>

<p>If UnrealEd is crashing at startup and you are getting an error message regarding
&quot;UEditorEngine::FinishAllSnaps &lt;- WM_USER_EXEC &lt;- VbWindowProc &lt;- glxDetectOutput&quot;, that is a separate problem that
seems to be caused by some sound card drivers.</p>

<p>You can avoid this crash by running &quot;UnrealEd -nosound&quot;.&nbsp; You don't get
any sound, but UnrealEd otherwise works fine for editing.</p>

<h4>Server Cheats?</h4>

<p>A few server admins have been reporting a cheat that enables clients without
administrative rights to change the speed of the server's game (as if typing &quot;slomo
0.5&quot; from the console in a local game).&nbsp; What's the trick?&nbsp; First person to
give the exact steps to duplicate the cheat gets a free signed copy of Unreal Tournament
as soon as it ships.&nbsp; Send reports to <a href="mailto:unreal225@epicgames.com">unreal225@epicgames.com</a> with a subject &quot;SLOMO CHEAT&quot;. Include your shipping address.</p>

<p>Are people seeing any other cheats occuring on the public Unreal servers?&nbsp; If so,
let us know, <a href="mailto:unreal225@epicgames.com">unreal225@epicgames.com</a> (no
prizes for this, we'll just fix the security holes!)</p>

<h4>UnrealEd for 3dfx Voodoo3 bundle owners</h4>

<p>The version of Unreal that shipped with 3dfx's Voodoo3 bundle didn't include UnrealEd.

&nbsp; So, we now have the <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Files/UnrealEdFix4.exe">Standalone UnrealEd Installer</a>
which installs UnrealEd.exe and all of its DLL's into the appropriate directories. &nbsp;
For this to work, you must have Unreal installed, and you must point the UnrealEd
installer to the same directory Unreal is in (for example c:\Unreal). Then just run
c:\Unreal\System\UnrealEd.exe to start editing.</p>
