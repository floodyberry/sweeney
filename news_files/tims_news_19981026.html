<h4>Direct3D Drivers</h4>

<p>To use Unreal's Direct3D support, you must have <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/download.asp">Microsoft DirectX
6.0</a> installed. You also need the <span class="strong">latest</span> Direct3D driver from your 3D
hardware maker.&nbsp; Because Unreal uses many new Direct3D features, many hardware makers
had to update their drivers for Unreal to work. Therefore, some of the drivers distributed
with DirectX 6.0 have problems with Unreal (crashes or visual anomalies).&nbsp; Here are
driver download sites for various brands: </p>

working reliably on all 3D hardware.</p>

<h4>Known Issues</h4>

<p>I've update the list of <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Bugs.htm">Known Issues</a>,
summarizing the problems people have found with 219.&nbsp; There are a bunch of items, but
most are non-showstoppers.&nbsp; I'm working on them now.&nbsp; Overall, though, 218 is by
far the best-received version of Unreal to date! New servers are popping up rapidly (50%
increase in the past 18 hours), with player counts rising even faster.</p>

<h4>Unreal 218 Gaining Support</h4>

<p>After releasing the patch at midnight Sunday night, it was amazing to see how many
Unreal servers had it up and running in less than an hour minutes.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to watch new Unreal servers spring up on the net now that our
Internet play quality is under control. In the not-too-distant future, we'll have many
more improvements in Unreal network play: performance enhancements, new features requested
by the community, and several cool upcoming surprises. GameSpy currently shows 27 Unreal
servers, and a couple thousand for Quake. Clearly, we got off to a very slow start while
we learned the the ins-and-outs of Internet game programming; now Unreal is on a solid
footing and we're really beginning to pick up the pace!</p>

<p>Level designers in the Unreal community have already started producing some great
Deathmatch maps (see <a href="http://www.freshmeat.org/unreal/">Unreal
Resources</a> for downloads), so we expect to see things accelerate in this area, too. </p>

<h4>PlanetUnreal performance survey</h4>

<p>If you're using the new 218 patch, please fill out <a
href="http://www.planetunreal.com/">PlanetUnreal's</a> Unreal performance survey.
&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll be watching Unreal players' feedback in the survey, and looking at all
the 218 bug reports sent to the <a href="mailto:unreal218@epicgames.com">unreal218@epicgames.com</a>
account.&nbsp; Everyone's feedback will be taken into account for future improvements to
the Internet play and other features.</p>

<h4>More about 3D API's</h4>

<p>In an interview on <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com">Voodoo
Extreme</a>, I gave my opinion in the ongoing OpenGL vs Direct3D debate, and I wanted to
add some more information here.</p>

<p>First of all, both our DreamForge partners working on the OpenGL support, and our
Direct3D partner have both done a very high-quality job, given the constraints of Unreal
and the 3D card drivers available.&nbsp; My feelings on the two 3D standards are based
completely on their API's and the quality of drivers available.</p>

<p>Next, I wanted to give some more detail on the code.</p>

<pre>API support layer      Lines of C++ code
3dfx Glide             1711
Direct3D               3123
NEC PowerVR            4049
OpenGL                 5697</pre>

<p>Now, the Glide is the simplest, because it's aimed at the Voodoo family of 3D cards,
which are very standard and straightforward to support.&nbsp; For programming to 3dfx
cards, Glide is the ideal API.&nbsp; For people thinking &quot;If Glide is so great, why
don't other 3D cards support it?&quot;&nbsp; The short answer is, if Glide supported other
manufacturer's 3D cards, it would pick up all the complications&nbsp; involved in
real-world Direct3D and OpenGL programming: Testing for core capabilities, working around
driver bugs, etc.</p>

<p>The Direct3D code is next in simplicity.&nbsp; It began as a working 1600 line driver,
then expanded as it was optimized and support was added for 3D cards that lack key
features.&nbsp; The Direct3D API follows the traditional Microsoft model of being not very
beautiful code, but dealing with real-world hardware robustly, by providing a
capability-querying mechanism and well-tested drivers.</p>

<p>The PowerVR code is large because the PCX2 chip's rendering approach is very different
than what Unreal was designed for.&nbsp; This makes the implementation fairly complex,
though the next-generation PowerVR, currently on-hold in the PC market while NEC focuses
on the Sega DreamCast, is a great chip that's more traditional in its architecture, and
more optimal for Unreal.</p>

<p>The OpenGL code is large because of optimizations and support for lots of real-world
hardware.&nbsp; If reduced to plain-vanilla OpenGL, this would probably be the simplest
and most stable driver of them all, because the OpenGL API is very straightforward.</p>

<h4>Unreal 218 Patch is ready!</h4>

<p>You can read the release notes and download the patch from the <a
href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Versions.htm">Patch Page</a>!&nbsp; Our test session
went well, and the participants (including a lot of modem players, and even some overseas
modem players) reported major success with the performance improvements.</p>

<p>Epic's two deathmatch servers have been upgraded to 218: <a
href="unreal://208.212.53.39:7777">Deathmatch 1</a> and <a
href="unreal://208.212.53.39:7787">Deathmatch 2</a>.&nbsp; However, since our T1 line is
going to be very saturated with people downloading the patch, performance probably won't
be very good on our server for the next several days.</p>
