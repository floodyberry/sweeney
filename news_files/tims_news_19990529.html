<h4>For server administrators only: Unreal 225e Patch</h4>

<p>This is a test version incorporating all of the latest server-side stability and
performance improvements.&nbsp; It's backwards compatible with Unreal 224 clients. &nbsp;
If you're running a 224 server and are experiencing performance or stability problems,
please upgrade.&nbsp; If you experience any server problems or server crashes with 225,
please email your Unreal.log file to <a href="mailto:unreal225@epicgames.com">unreal225@epicgames.com</a>
so we can investigate the problems.&nbsp; The results on our test server here at Epic
indicate that this version is significantly faster (i.e. supports more players) than 224,
and is more stable but I don't expect it to be perfect, because I rewrote about a thousand
lines of server code to improve performance, and there will probably be some bugs to shake
out.</p>

<p>Only download this if you are running an Unreal server: <a
href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Files/UnrealPatch225e.exe">UnrealPatch225e.exe</a>.</p>

<p>The general Unreal 225 patch for everybody including users will be available in a few
days.</p>

<h4>On engine licensing</h4>

<p>In this <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/274561.asp#BODY">MSNBC
interview</a>, I think John Carmack hit the nail on the head on the &quot;build vs.
buy&quot; decision that goes into licensing an engine:</p>

<blockquote><div>
  <p>&quot;If you want to aim for something that's 100 percent proprietary and
  you're willing to take 18 months longer on the project to develop the technology
  while running a significant risk of abject failure, you make your own game engine. If
  you've been to a few E3's, you've probably seen a dozen instances of
  somebody making a really, really cool demo that's showing off some new technical
  direction - then the game never comes out.&quot;</p>
</div></blockquote>

<p>Though game engine licensing was occuring over two years ago, we're still very much in
the early days of this rapidly growing and evolving market: Game developers are learning
what an engine can and can't do for them, and engine developers are still learning the
ropes of the business models, engine modularity, support, and version management.</p>

<p>I'm happy to see the press treating engines level-headedly: everyone seem to recognize
that an engine is a useful tool that can speed development and enable a developer to focus
on game development rather than technology; but also that an engine is just a tool and
isn't a miracle solution for game development.&nbsp; When an exciting new technology is
evolving, there's always a danger of it being massively overhyped and pushed as a cure-all
solution (see Java), but engines seem to have received a fair showing, not unrealistically
positive or negative.</p>

<h4>UnrealEd &quot;Runtime Error 20005&quot; Experimental Fix</h4>

<p>People who are getting the infamous &quot;Runtime Error 20005&quot; or other problems
when UnrealEd is initializing, please install this <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Files/UnrealEdFix.exe">Experimental
Fix</a>, then try running UnrealEd again.&nbsp; Does this solve the problem for you?

&nbsp; Please email <a href="mailto:unreal225@epicgames.com">unreal225@epicgames.com</a>
and let us know either way.&nbsp; Note: This is a feedback email address, not tech
support.</p>

<p>Webmasters: Can we please not post this on big general gaming sites?&nbsp; I want to
get feedback from users on the effectiveness of the fix before widely publicizing it. I'll
post the results here in a couple of days.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
