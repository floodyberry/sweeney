<h4>Network Objects Follow-Up</h4>

<p>I've chatted with several people lately who have added insight to the discussion of
multi-language programming and networking.&nbsp; One interesting topic mentioned was using
the CORBA protocol to coordinate network games.&nbsp; CORBA is a high-reliability protocol
with a fairly high amount of overhead and latency, due to its exacting nature and use of
TCP.&nbsp; I see CORBA as a very suitable protocol for network game backbones. For
example, if you were doing an Ultima Online style world with multiple servers that stay in
synch, CORBA would be good for linking servers together in a high-reliability, non
performance-critical way. But, CORBA isn't suited for an actual realtime modem-based
gameplay protocol, since it's TCP based (which adds terrible lag under lossy conditions),
and the protocol has enough overhead that it's not going to be able to handle large
amounts of data over the modem.</p>

<h4>AWT</h4>

<p><a href="http://unrealscript.net/AWT/">AWT</a> is a graphical
user-interface layer for UnrealScript, which has been making some cool progress lately.</p>

<h4>Cheat Challenge Update</h4>

<p>I've received a bunch of tips from two Unreal enthusiasts.&nbsp; Congratulations go to
Mek @ PlanetUnreal and RisingSun for discovering and verifying two holes in Unreal, and to
Mike Lambert for suggesting a potential third one.&nbsp; Also, thanks all the players who
provided observations they saw of potential cheating online.&nbsp; I'll write more about
these techniques after the next patch has been released, and the holes plugged.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you too have figured out how to cheat in Unreal, pat yourself on
the back, you outsmarted me!&nbsp; But also, please resist the temptation to cheat on the
public deathmatch servers...it spoils the fun.</p>

<h4>Another Public Master Server</h4>

<p>This just in:</p>

<blockquote><div>
  <p>How about a mention of the OGN Public Unreal Master Server? It's been
  available for almost two weeks and has no access restrictions, bandwidth or otherwise. The
  server is running @ master.ogn.org:27500. Server lists can be retrieved @ <a
  href="http://master.ogn.org:6669/list/game/unreal">http://master.ogn.org:6669/list/game/unreal</a>.
  A page describing how to link to it can be found @ <a
