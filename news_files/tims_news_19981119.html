<h4>Unreal 220 Internet Improvements</h4>

<p>I'm now down in Raleigh, North Carolina with the rest of the Unreal team.&nbsp; Things
are really coming together for the top-secret project we're working on, and Unreal 220 is
starting to solidify.&nbsp; We don't have a release date yet, but it could be as early as
next week.</p>

<p>The Internet play improvements in 220 are quite noticeable. &nbsp; Steve and I are
using a new physics prediction scheme based on motion compensation.&nbsp; This improves
the smoothness of other players' movement in deathmatch games, especially in large, open
levels like DmDeck16, where lots of players are visible.</p>

<p>Steve has redesigned the moving brush code so that moving brushes now are now handled
client-side.&nbsp; Platforms and doors are very smooth now.&nbsp; Finally, I've created a
new scheme for managing temporary actors like projectiles, which reduces their bandwidth
by about 30%.</p>

<p>Steve and Brandon have also added a lot of other improvements, such as showing ping
times, server name, and level name in the player list, showing the name of opponents when
you point the crosshair at them in a network game, a beep when chat messages come in, and
color coding of messages.</p>

<h4>Unreal Editor Progress</h4>

<p>I've also been working on the new Unreal Editor, featuring a user-interface rewrite
(moving over to C++ from Visual Basic). It's now more than half-way done. &nbsp;
Architecturally, the new editor code is far more general than the old UnrealEd. &nbsp; The
editor itself is very abstract, and almost all functionality is implemented through
plug-ins.&nbsp; There are plug-in interfaces for brush builders, views of objects (like 3D
scenes and the 2D editor), view controllers, import tools, export tools, browsers, and
operations on arbitrary kinds of objects.&nbsp; Plug-ins can even define their own sub
plug-in interfaces, etc.</p>

<p>This new approach will provide a more solid foundation for Unreal 1 editing, but the
big gains will come in the next-generation engine.&nbsp; A major bottleneck in creating
the Unreal 1 engine was the complex coupling between the rendering engine and the editor,
which made it difficult to modify the renderer.&nbsp; The new approach generalizes the
concept of editing, and will make it easier to add cool new features which require editor
support.</p>

<p>I plan to start releasing public betas of the new UnrealEd as soon as it's really
stabilized, with the first beta in the first week or two of 1999 if all goes well.</p>

<p>We have long planned to release the editor as a full retail product through GT
Interactive after it has been cleaned up and finalized, but there doesn't seem to be
enough mainstream retail interest to justify it.&nbsp; So, unless something changes real
soon, we'll plan to release the final version freely, with the manual provided in HtmlHelp
format rather than printed.</p>

<h4>Web Site Notes</h4>

<p>A request of web sites providing collections of Unreal related files, such as the cool <a
href="http://www.freshmeat.org/unreal/">Unreal Resources</a> page: Please
link to the official <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Versions.htm">Download</a> page for the Unreal patches,
rather than mirroring specific patch versions locally.&nbsp; A bunch of web sites have old
Unreal patches in their download sections (as old as the 1.01 patch), which are no longer
relevent.&nbsp; If everyone links to the central <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Versions.htm">Download</a> page,
users are more likely to get the latest patch. Thanks! </p>

<p>Cool Unreal related things I've seen recently... </p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://unrealnation.com/unloaded/">Unloaded</a>, a great &quot;overhead view&quot; mod including some custom levels. It feels a lot like the classic arcade game
    Gauntlet.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.astro.uni-bonn.de/~cloewe/unreal/">AEus' Unreal Stats Page</a>, a
    totally cool stats tool for server administrators.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.unrealed.com/">UnrealEd.com</a> has grown to contain more and more
    useful UnrealEd resources.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Unreal mod notes</h4>

<p>Mod developers who get the cryptic &quot;sandbox&quot; error when trying their mods in
network play: This error means you have a .upkg file that says server-side-only because
you copied the one from IpDrv.u (which is SUPPOSED to be server-side-only).&nbsp; This
usually prevents the mod from working, but sometimes just causes actors defined in the mod
to not be visible to players.&nbsp; If you don't have a .upkg problem, you won't have a
problem.&nbsp; If you do have a .upkg file, it should read:</p>

<pre>[Flags]
AllowDownload=False
ClientOptional=False
ServerSideOnly=False</pre>
