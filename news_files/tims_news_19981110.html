<h4>Latest News</h4>

<p>The latest <a href="http://www.planetunreal.com/">PlanetUnreal</a>
survey shows a significant gain in gamers' satisfaction with the latest 219 patch,
compared to the previous ones.&nbsp; We're now hammering on version 220, which includes
significant new Internet play improvements, plus some core game improvements that the rest
of the team has been working on. 220 won't be out this week, but should be ready soon
after.</p>

<p>There seems to be one Internet problem in 219 that is affecting 10-15% of players.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't figured out the cause yet, but the symptom is a ping time
(visible with STAT NET) that swings around wildly, going from 200 to 1000 or more over the
course of several seconds.&nbsp; Many of these players report that other games like Quake
2 don't exhibit the problem--which indicates it's not just a bad connection or ISP. &nbsp;
I suspect packet-ordering problems, though I haven't been able to duplicate it here.</p>

<h4>The Roadmap</h4>

<p>In the remainder of 1998, we will be releasing: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Unreal 219: Latest version. Download <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Versions.htm">here</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Unreal 220: Further Internet improvements, core game improvements, bug fixes. </li>
  <li>Unreal 221: Incremental fixes </li>

  <li>Unreal 222: Offical (non-beta) patch; shareware version will be released. </li>
  <li>Additional patches as necessary. </li>
</ul>

<p>We also have some cool things in the works for 1999.&nbsp; Since Unreal first shipped,
I've been working on Internet improvements and bug fixes, while the rest of the team has
been working on a top-secret project we are referring to as &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;.
&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been a lot of rumors and speculation about what this project will
be.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the rumors are completely incorrect. For example, we are <span class="italic">not</span>

using any alien technology recovered from crashed spaceships on Tournament. (We're saving
that for our <span class="italic">next</span> project).</p>

<p>I'm also working on the new, enhanced UnrealEd, with lots of new features, improved
stability, a plug-in interface, and other goodies. We don't have a date for this, but I'm
expecting a public beta around new years, with final release early in 1999.</p>

<p>At some point, we'll be publically releasing Unreal's C++ interface so the community
can start on .dll plug-ins for Unreal and UnrealEd.&nbsp; This will happen no later than
the new UnrealEd public beta.&nbsp; It might be possible to release it sooner, however
there are changes in the works which won't be binary compatible, so user-created .dll's
would break and need to be recompiled.</p>

<p>What can you do with Unreal .dll's? Lots. Here are some examples: </p>


<ul>
  <li>Define new kinds of algorithmic textures that can be created in UnrealEd and used in
    levels. </li>
  <li>Expose anything you can do in C++ to UnrealScript, for example the file system, ActiveX,
    more Internet functionality, etc. </li>
  <li>Write performance-critical game support routines, such as AI. </li>
</ul>

<p>While it's also possible to write game code directly in C++, the preferable way to do
that is UnrealScript, since there is already a lot of game support infrastructure built
into the language.</p>

<h4>Server Administration</h4>

<p>Remote server administration isn't working in 219, but will be addressed shortly. 219
does have a few new features for local server administration.&nbsp; While running a
server, click on the Unreal server icon and choose &quot;Show log window&quot;. In the
log, you can type: </p>

<ul>
  <li>SERVERTRAVEL &lt;levelname&gt;: Jump to a new server. </li>
  <li>SAY &lt;message&gt;: Broadcast a message to all users. </li>

</ul>
