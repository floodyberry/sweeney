<h4>Known Bugs</h4>

<p>Having a problem with Unreal?&nbsp; Please visit the <a href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Bugs.htm">Known Bugs</a>
page to see if we know about it and are addressing it, and if there any any workarounds.</p>

<h4>Future Patch</h4>

<p>There will be another Unreal 1 patch.&nbsp; It will be 225.&nbsp; It will contain fixes
for the significant bugs reported that are under our control (3D card drivers are
dependent on the hardware makers).&nbsp; By popular demand, our focus on future Unreal 1
patches will be making bug fixes and small, incremental improvements.&nbsp; So, we've
split off the Unreal 1 code base from the Unreal Tournament code base, and won't be major
new features added to the Unreal 1 code base, just fixes.</p>

<p>This code split gives the server community some room to get back together and grow
healthily.&nbsp; The server community was fragmented in the past because of our Unreal 224
delays, at one point having 4 major versions available (220 for the PC, 219 for the Mac,
222 for U.S. 3dfx Voodoo3 users, 223 for European 3dfx Voodoo3 users.&nbsp; From here on,
we'll keep network compatibility between versions, and keep code changes to a minimum.
&nbsp; And we'll keep Unreal 1 script compatibility (but not UT script compatibility).</p>

<p>The split also gives us more flexibility in releasing future patches.&nbsp; In the
past, we've been adding so many new features to the engine for Unreal Tournament, some
necessitating architectural changes, that we've had a long internal testing cycle for each
patch.&nbsp; From now on, the Unreal 1 changes will be simple and localized.</p>

<p>The split is also something our Unreal tech licensees have wanted.&nbsp; From here on,
our partners who want to ship games soon (before or soon after Unreal Tournament) will
prefer to stay on the 224 track to gain stability and minimize changes, and those with
further-off products may want to move forward with the Unreal Tournament code track, to
keep up to date with the latest features.</p>

<p>I'll be making a summary of reported bugs, workaround, and related feedback from the
community later tonight.</p>

<h4>OpenGL UnrealEd</h4>

<p>Thanks <a href="http://www.planetunreal.com/">PlanetUnreal</a> for
pointing out this feature I added months ago but basically forgot about. :)</p>

<p>Though it theoretically works, the consumer OpenGL drivers I've tried aren't yet stable
enough for it to work reliably on real-world hardware.&nbsp; But for people who like
experimenting, if in-game OpenGL support works flawlessly, you can try editor OpenGL
support by changing the WindowedRenderDevice= line in Unreal.ini to
WindowedRenderDevice=OpenGLDrv.OpenGLRenderDevice.&nbsp; Problems I've experienced on my
Riva TNT and ATI Rage Pro (2 months ago) include crashing in the display driver when
resing windows, failure to create HRC's when opening windows, and texture corruption.</p>

<p>If there is enough demand, perhaps we can pressure 3D hardware makers to test with
UnrealEd.&nbsp; Hopefully this will be easier now that we've released Unreal's OpenGL
source code to the public.</p>
