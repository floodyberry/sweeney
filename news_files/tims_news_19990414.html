<h4>3dfx Voodoo3 Totally Rocks!</h4>

<p>I just picked up a carload of the new Voodoo3 3000's; we've put them to good use, as
the team is now testing the upcoming 224 patch.</p>

<p>The performance and graphical quality of the Voodoo3 are simply amazing.&nbsp; Though
we've had a board for over a month, beta drivers and pre-release board problems prevented
us from realizing just how far ahead of the pack this hardware is.</p>

<p>On the PC, most technological improvements come in little incremental improvements,
such that we seldom have a chance to experience a single major leap.&nbsp; Back when 3dfx
introduced the Voodoo 1, that was one of those rare leaps.&nbsp; Since I've been off
working on &quot;OpenGL land&quot; on the Riva TNT, ATI Rage 128, and other accelerators,
I haven't had a 3dfx card in my machine since soon after Unreal shipped.&nbsp; So, for me
at least, getting a Voodoo3 and being able to play at those ultra high resolutions at a
great frame rate, is another one of those leaps.</p>

<p>While the Voodoo3's fill rate is outstandling, where the card really clobbers all
others is its texture management performance.&nbsp; This is a very important
characteristic, because it determines how smooth the performance is from frame-to-frame.
&nbsp; Unreal, though it shipped nearly a year ago, still pushes texture limits harder
than other 3D action games, and Unreal Tournament pushes them even harder.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Unreal 224 performance is also being helped by some new lighting optimizations, and a
major new engine feature, which Erik de Neve (Unreal optimization and algorithmic texture
guru) has been working on.&nbsp; But I'm not allowed to talk about that since Mark Rein is
writing a press release about it now.</p>

<p>Note: Unreal 220 is incompatible with Voodoo3's due to some changes that were made to
Glide; people who have Voodoo3 2000's will need the upcoming 224 patch.&nbsp; </p>
