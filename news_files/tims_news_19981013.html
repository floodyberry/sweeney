<h4>Unreal Cheat-Finding Challenge</h4>

<p>I've seen two reports that people have found a way to cheat in Internet play.
&nbsp;&nbsp; One person reported seeing a little tiny 1-inch tall player walking around
named &quot;LilTinyChessPiece&quot;, and another reported a player who never took damage.
&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been scouring the code, and haven't found any holes which would enable
this kind of cheating, but I'd love to hear if anybody has found a way.</p>

<p>If you find a way for players to cheat or crash servers over the Internet in Unreal,
please email <a href="mailto:tim@epicgames.com">me</a>.&nbsp; The first person to report a
particular security hole in Unreal will receive credit and thanks here for helping to
protect the Unreal community from cheaters.</p>

<p>People who cheat in Deathmatch are lamers, but people who are motivated by simply <span class="em">discovering
ways to cheat</span> are doing valuable research.</p>

<p>Note: I don't consider the following things Unreal cheats: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Server administrators cheating on their own server. Since the admin is in control of the
    server, there are many ways he could disadvantage players (in any game, not just Unreal),
    but fortunately people who go to the effort of setting up their own server tend to be
    honest and respectful of the community. </li>
  <li>Any of the standard TCP/IP tricks people can use to confuse Web &amp; FTP servers, such
    as SYN flooding, packet flooding, DNS spoofing, and so on.&nbsp; These aren't
    Unreal-specific cheats, and I can't stop them. </li>

</ul>

<h4>UnrealScript Notes</h4>

<p>There was recently a &quot;to script or not to script&quot; debate about the merits of
UnrealScript vs pure C/C++.&nbsp; In this debate, several misconceptions were put forth,
which I want to correct: </p>

<ol>
  <li><p>UnrealScript replicated functions (described in the <a
    href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/Network.htm">Network Architecture Documentation</a>)
    indeed return instantly, rather than blocking execution while waiting for network
    acknowledgement.&nbsp; Function calls are sent across the network using an asynchronous
    RPC-like approach, and are executed upon reception. &nbsp; They can either be sent wih
    guaranteed delivery and sequencing (by using the &quot;reliable&quot; keyword), or without
    sequencing (using &quot;unrelible&quot;). &nbsp; Unreliable replicated functions are most
    efficient, and should be used for non-vital events like hearing sounds.</p>

    <p>
    If one were to assume UnrealScript functions were synchronous and blocking, one would
    indeed draw incorrect conclusions such as this statement: &quot;That must make AIs in
    multiplayer games really fun, they fire at you and do an RPC, then freeze until they get a
    ping back from the client.&quot;</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>As our licensees know, UnrealScript classes and C++ classes fully interoperate. &nbsp;
    You can derive C++ classes from UnrealScript classes, and vice-versa.&nbsp; For all actor
    classes, running &quot;Unreal.exe -make&quot; automatically parses the UnrealScript
    classes, and generates C++ stubs for them, including:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>C++ variable declarations mirroring the UnrealScript ones, allowing variables to be
        accessed identically in either language. </li>
      <li>C++ -&gt; UnrealScript calling stubs, enabling C++ functions to call into UnrealScript
        functions. </li>
      <li>UnrealScript -&gt; C++ calling stubs, enabling UnrealScript functions to call into C++. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Indeed, we invested a lot of effort into providing dual programming interfaces,
    enabling seamless sharing of objects and code between the two languages.&nbsp; Among other
    things, I studied COM, MFC/VB/ActiveX, CORBA/IDL, and JNI in order to determine the most
    efficient and least error-prone methods of cross-language programming. There is a lot of
    great research material on the net, for those who are interested.</p>
    <p>I suspect that people who have a low opinion of mixed-language programming have likely
    drawn their conclusions from JNI and CORBA/IDL which do indeed involve a lot of messy
    handle/id references and error-prone redundent declaration of objects.&nbsp; It doesn't <span class="em">have</span>
    to be this way.&nbsp; For an example of &quot;cross-language programming done right&quot;,
    check out the ActiveX support in Microsoft Visual J++ and Visual Basic -- they're
    ultra-clean, automatic, and they involve no redundency.&nbsp; MFC also does a pretty good
    nearly-automatic job of cross-language ActiveX object handling.&nbsp; Mixed-language
    programming can be very fruitful, if it's implemented properly.</p>

  </li>
  <li>Unreal performs all file loading and saving using serialization.&nbsp; Serialization is
    automatic for objects defined in UnrealScript.&nbsp; For objects and structures defined
    only in C++, such as the following function that serializes a vector. <pre>friend FArchive&amp; FVector::operator&lt;&lt;( FArchive&amp; Ar, FVector&amp; V )
{
        return Ar &lt;&lt; V.X &lt;&lt; V.Y &lt;&lt; V.Z;
}</pre>
