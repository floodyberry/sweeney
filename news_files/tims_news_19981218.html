<h4>Unreal Tournament notes for mod authors</h4>

<p>I've had several inquiries from mod makers about how hard it will be to &quot;port maps
and mods from Unreal 1 to Unreal Tournament&quot;.&nbsp; The answer is, port?&nbsp; What's
this talk of porting?&nbsp; This stuff <span class="italic">just works</span>.</p>

<p>Steve Polge put a lot of effort into updating the Unreal 220+ game code so that it
integrates seamlessly with Unreal Tournament.&nbsp; Both products install into the \Unreal
directory, and are mutually compatible.&nbsp; So, you can install one, the other, or both
-- and existing maps and mods which are compatible with the latest version of Unreal, will
be fully compatible.</p>

<p>For convenience, Unreal Tournament ships with all of the script packages from Unreal 1
(including UnrealShare.u and UnrealI.u), all of the .utx files, and all of the .uax files.
&nbsp; Unreal Tournament is a superset of the Unreal 1 with the exception of the Unreal 1
maps and music.&nbsp; All new UT content (lots of scripts, textures, sounds, game types,
and new actors) are designed to interoperate with the existing ones in Unreal 1.</p>

<p>The new player code is implemented in a subclass of UnrealIPlayer, which means that
Unreal Tournament players will work in user-created deathmatch maps for Unreal 1. &nbsp;

However, the new UnrealTournamentPlayer classes and meshes include new features and
animations, so you can choose to take advantage of this (and require UT), or not. &nbsp;
The new game types are GameInfo subclasses.&nbsp; The new weapons and pickups interoperate
with the old ones.</p>

<p>UnrealEd supports Unreal Tournament maps without any modifications.&nbsp; This
&quot;just works&quot; in the same way that most of the licensees use UnrealEd without
modifications.</p>

<p>One huge Unreal Tournament feature that script programmers will be interested in is the
all-new user interface code.&nbsp; While Unreal 1's menus are functional, the &quot;look
and feel&quot; is basically derived from Doom's menus, which were derived from Wolfenstein
3D's menus, which probably date back to some even earlier id Software game.</p>

<p>The new game UI is a cutting-edge redesign, and continues our tradition of creating
code and tools which licensees and mod makers can endlessly customize and tweak.&nbsp; I
can't say more about it yet, but the ongoing joke is that we're going to rename it
UnrealOS (it's just a joke, but the analogy will become clear later).&nbsp; Maybe we'll
release UI screenshots at some point.</p>
