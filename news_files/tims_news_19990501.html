<h4>224 Progress Continued</h4>

<p>The team found about 10 bugs in Unreal 224t that are significant and merit fixing
before release, so I'm just wrapping up fixes for them now, and we'll have another release
candidate (224u) in internal testing this afternoon. Thanks for the patience...we're
almost there.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bluesnews.com/">Blues News</a> posted a huge <a
href="http://www.bluesnews.com/screenshots/ut/utshot1.shtml">3DS Max
rendering</a> of a bunch of Unreal Tournament characters.&nbsp; These are the actual
meshes (same poly count as the game), but textures of this resolution will only be
available on cards that support S3TC texture compression such as the Savage4 (though other
cards will have support soon).&nbsp; Current 3D cards will have to make due with four
256x256 textures per player.&nbsp; Our new skinning method enables player meshes to be
mapped with four textures, so we can have separate faces and armor.&nbsp; This Ultima
Online inspired approach lets players customize their look more than past 3D action games.</p>
