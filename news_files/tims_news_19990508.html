<h4>Latest progress</h4>

<p>All the known server-crashing problems in 224 have been fixed and are in internal
testing now.&nbsp; Stability has improved quite a bit.&nbsp; There is still significantly
higher server CPU usage in 224 compared to 220 on heavily populated servers, and I'm still
tracking this down.</p>

<p>The Direct3D code has been cleaned up and optimized a bit, giving a few FPS improvement
on the Riva TNT, with support for detail textures now enabled.&nbsp; 225 will include the
new D3D driver, and the 225 public source release will include the source.</p>
