<h4>Latest Happenings</h4>

<p>Since the Unreal 218 patch was released, the number of Unreal servers showing up in
GameSpy has increased by 225%.&nbsp; A huge thanks to everyone who is running Unreal
servers now.&nbsp; It's awesome to see the community grow and begin to reach critical
mass.</p>

<p>At any time, about 20% of the servers listed in GameSpy are shown as &quot;Not
Responding&quot;.&nbsp; I've been looking into this, and there are three reasons for this.

&nbsp;&nbsp; One, the server has been shut down or crashed but hasn't timed out and been
removed from the list.&nbsp; Two, the server is switching levels, which prevents it from
responding to GameSpy queries for 5-20 seconds.&nbsp; Third, the server is shown in
GameSpy because a user running a LAN server (dedicated or non-dedicated) enabled the
&quot;DoUplink&quot; option to publicise their server to the world without realizing the
consequences, but either exited or is on a LAN blocked off by a firewall.&nbsp; We'll work
with the GameSpy guys to adjust the timeouts so that fewer &quot;Not Responding&quot;
servers are listed.</p>

<h4>Status of Direct3d - All Drivers</h4>

<p>Some issues across-the-board with switching between fullscreen and windowed mode, and
switching resolutions during gameplay. We're looking into theses issues.</p>

<h4>Riva TNT</h4>

<p>Has lots of potential, but there are major problems with their Direct3D driver: rainbow
colors, time-lag, w-buffering issues, missing textures.&nbsp; We are hoping nVidia will
issue an updated driver soon.&nbsp; The ball is in their court now.</p>

<h4>Riva 128</h4>

<p>Their latest driver should run Unreal OK.&nbsp; The framerate isn't very good, and
there will be a lot of &quot;stuttering&quot; since texture downloads are very slow on
this hardware.&nbsp; Some users are reporting that creature polygons appear corrupted.
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hopefully nVidia will fix thie error in their driver.</p>

<h4>Intel i740</h4>

<p>There are some problems with their currently-available Direct3D driver, but they have
an internal beta driver which fixes many problems.&nbsp; Hopefully this will be ready for
the public soon.</p>

<h4>ATI Rage Pro</h4>

<p>They have a beta Direct3D driver which runs Unreal pretty well (though it doesn't
appear to be available for public release yet).&nbsp; Multitexturing currently isn't
working with Unreal, because of a hardware limitation (it can't multitexture a paletted
base texture map along with a non-paletted light map).</p>

<h4>3dfx Voodoo2</h4>

<p>There isn't any reason to use Direct3D for Voodoo2, since we support Glide natively and
that tends to be more stable and faster, but their latest Direct3D driver does run Unreal
pretty well.&nbsp; Their detail texture blending (D3DBLEND_DIFFUSEALPHA) doesn't work,
which breaks detail textures.&nbsp; There are reports of missing lightmaps in some areas
(not sure what's wrong).&nbsp; 3dfx could get a performance increase here by implementing
subrect Blts and hardware triangle-fan setup.</p>

<h4>S3 Savage 3D</h4>

<p>Works well with their internal beta Direct3D driver.&nbsp; Not sure when this will be
available via the web.</p>

<h4>Matrox G200</h4>

<p>Works pretty well.</p>

<h4>Rendition</h4>

<p>Works pretty well.</p>

<h4>Permedia</h4>

<p>Only supports monochrome lighting due to blending limitations.&nbsp; Explosions are
displayed with a black background (due to a bug in the current Unreal code).&nbsp; Fairly
slow texture downloading -- performance isn't great.</p>

<h4>Drivers we consider playable, in best-to-worst order</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Voodoo2: Fastest of all. </li>
  <li>Savage/G200: Reasonable performance. Not as fast a fill rate as Voodoo2, but texture
    downloads are fast, and they support palettes, making for a steady frame rate. </li>
  <li>Rage Pro/Rendition: Reasonable performance. High display quality in truecolor mode. </li>
</ul>

<p>The others should be playable pending public release of improved Direct3D drivers for
their hardware.</p>

<p>On Permedia, Riva 128, and Rendition, you may get better performance using Unreal's
software renderer, especially if you have a Pentium II class processor.&nbsp; This isn't
such a bad thing, because the software renderer supports all of Unreal's key features,
including truecolor lighting and volumetric fog.</p>
