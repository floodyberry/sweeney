<h4>Direct3D Is Happening</h4>

<p>We're testing 226a internally now.&nbsp; The results of are good so far.&nbsp; If no
significant &quot;non-driver&quot; problems are found, we'll have Unreal 226a out later
this week.&nbsp; Here is the kind of feedback we're seeing on D3D Unreal performance.</p>

<blockquote><div>
  <p>First client impressions, after zonking it with a couple of really
  nasty, detailed, clippy, high polycount maps: incredible improvement! I got through
  DMDowntown, my personal UnrealRavager(tm) with nary a clip, pop or tick. Switching
  resolutions works well now, but you have to have the latest Hercules driver (now using
  1.70, dated 6-28-99) for it to work, or you get a critical error. ALT-ENTER works fine
  too, thanks Tim (now I can get multiple screenshots without exiting and restarting
  Unreal). DMBreakfast, a new map which uses a great deal of UnrealEd rendered graphics,
  played very well too.</p>

  <p>This is a quantum leap for the 'in game' video speed on the Hercules
  TNT2. Most impressive. I'll try to get this patch on the Nali City game server
  (unreal://207.53.187.28) tomorrow so we can all beat it up.</p>

<p>This isn't a miracle improvement, but TNT, G400, and Rage 128 owners
should see clear speed and smoothness gains. Just make sure you get the latest drivers
available for your card.</p>
