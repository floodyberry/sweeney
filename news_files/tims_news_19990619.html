<h4>Unreal Direct3D</h4>

<p>Our Direct3D performance and stability have increased significantly since version 225.
&nbsp; For the past few days, I've been swapping 3D cards in and out, tuning Unreal's
Direct3D performance on all of them.&nbsp; I'm not in the benchmarking biz, so I'm just
going to give my personal reaction from playing, and say that the Riva TNT, TNT2, Matrox
G400, and ATI Rage 128 are all very nice for playing Unreal now!</p>

<p>(Don't ask about the Riva 128, Rage Pro, and Permedia 2, they are worse for gameplay
than Unreal's software renderer).</p>

<p>Everyone's complaint with Direct3D support in past versions of Unreal, on good cards
like the TNT, has been &quot;the average frame rate and benchmark numbers are fine, but
there is major hitching and pausing during gameplay&quot;.&nbsp; This was due to several
factors, which I tracked down and fixed with help and advice from some driver writers.
&nbsp; The key improvements are: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Dramatically less memory usage.&nbsp; My Direct3D code wasted tons of hidden,
    &quot;behind the scenes&quot; memory while swapping textures into video memory, leading to
    lots of virtual-memory swapping.</li>

  <li>New texture management code, better optimized for Unreal's texture usage patterns.
    &nbsp; I had been relying on Direct3D's built-in texture manager, which is slowed down by
    its generality.</li>
</ol>

<p>The next patch (&quot;when it's done&quot;) will incorporate the new Direct3D code.
&nbsp; This will be out before Unreal Tournament ships, and we'll be looking for feedback
from players on its performance and stability.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank Ben de Waal, Sim Dietrich, and Doug Rogers at NVidia; Sameer Nene at
Microsoft; and Eric Le at Matrox for providing cool advice and performance tips.</p>

<h4>Summary of things I learned about Direct3D</h4>

<p>Never ever Lock() a video memory surface. That is <span class="italic">amazingly</span> slow, especially
on TNT cards.&nbsp; When I went to a pure Blt() based texture handling scheme, my
worst-case frame rate went from 8 fps to 20 fps.</p>

<p>Games that use large amounts of textures, palettized textures especially, should not
use DDSCAPS2_TEXTUREMANAGE.&nbsp; Write your own texture manager, and optimize it around
your game's usage patterns.&nbsp; You can get much better performance than using the
general-purpose one that's built in.</p>

<p>Realize that DDSCAPS2_TEXTUREMANAGE makes system-memory copies of all your textures as
backing-store for the ones cached in video memory temporarily.&nbsp; If your native
textures are palettized and the 3D card doesn't support paletted textures (a very common
case with Unreal), realize that you're going to end up with major memory waste. &nbsp;
Unreal 225 and earlier kept around (a) its own 8-bit copy of each texture, (b) the D3D
texture manager's 16-bit copy of each texture, and (c) the 16-bit video memory copy.
&nbsp; In Unreal in some cases, this wasted 40+ megs of system RAM!&nbsp; When I dumped
DDSCAPS2_TEXTUREMANAGE, I went down to about 12 megs of system RAM.&nbsp; Better yet, a
lot of cool new cards like the TNT2 and G400 have 32 megs of video memory, so you can
effectively store all your textures there, and free the system memory copies (which I do),
to bring the waste down to 0.&nbsp; This improves smoothness very significantly by
reducing virtual memory usage.</p>

<p>Realize that DDSCAPS2_TEXTUREMANAGE can potentially do evil stuff to your frame rate,
for example if it tries to free many small textures to make room for a big texture. &nbsp;

(It's totally general-purpose, so it has to handle all the bizarre inputs you might throw
at it).</p>

<p>Never allocate or free video-memory textures during gameplay in Direct3D.&nbsp; This
operation is slow.&nbsp; Do it at init time.&nbsp; I do this in Unreal now, caching all
textures into fixed-size bins in video memory.&nbsp; I swap textures into the bins in
realtime, but never reallocate the bins.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to constrain your engine, texture formats, texture sizes, etc to get
optimal Direct3D performance.&nbsp; GENERAL==SLOW, especially when dealing with texture
management, where you are already pushing RAM and memory bandwidth limits.</p>

<p>Overall, Direct3D has come a long way.&nbsp; The API and drivers are quite stable now.
&nbsp; In my 100 hours of rewriting the Direct3D code and testing it on 10+ different 3D
cards under Windows 98, I had 5 lockups.&nbsp; This is about the same as my experience
with OpenGL on Windows NT.</p>
