<h4>Unreal 218 patch information (RTFM!)</h4>

<p>If you downloaded the 218 patch, please <a
href="http://unreal.epicgames.com/versions.htm">read the release notes</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; If
you're still experiencing problems with Unreal on your modem connection, you need to use
the NETSPEED command described there, so that Unreal doesn't try to use more bandwidth
than you have available.</p>

<h4>Resources for Server Administrators</h4>

<p>Here are some resources to aid new Unreal server administrators in getting up and
running: </p>

<h4>Unreal Multiplayer Ramp-Up</h4>

<p>A lot of news sites have been picking up on Unreal's multiplayer improvements: </p>

<p>The number of public Unreal servers listed in GameSpy is now up to 51 as I write this,
and has been growing at a rate of over 20% daily.&nbsp; While working on the upcoming 219
patch, I've been spending a couple hours each day playing Unreal online, especially on the
servers running user-created levels.&nbsp; The community has made some really impressive
levels, and I'm glad to see that a lot of servers are now making use of downloadable
levels, textures, sounds, and music.</p>

<h4>Other Servers</h4>

<p>In addition to the public servers listed in GameSpy, there are 14 extremely high
quality, public servers on <a href="http://www.won.net/unreal">World
Opponent Network</a> listed in their own web-based &quot;server finder&quot; site.</p>

<p>I should also mention our other online partner, <a
href="http://www.mplayer.com/action/games/unreal/">MPlayer</a>, and the <a
href="http://www.mplayer.com/action/unreal/">Unreal Kingdom</a> news site
on MPlayer.</p>
