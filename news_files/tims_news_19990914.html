<h4>Unreal Tournament demo schedule</h4>

<p>To quote <a href="http://www.voodooextreme.com/">Voodoo Extreme</a>
quoting me :), here's the Unreal Tournament demo release plan: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Windows 3dfx demo this week.</li>
  <li>Windows Direct3D/OpenGL next week.</li>

  <li>Linux Glide/OpenGL soon after.</li>
  <li>Mac timing not figured out yet.</li>
</ul>

<h4>DirectX7</h4>

<p>Microsoft's new DirectX7 API will be released soon.&nbsp; I've already ported Unreal
Tournament's Direct3D code to DirectX7 and have noticed a nice speedup on the TNT2 and
GeForce256, primarily due to improved texture management.</p>

<p>The API's simplicity has also improved, which is something you don't often see: usually
code just gets more complex as it evolves.&nbsp; Porting Unreal Tournament's code from
DirectX6 to DirectX7 only took 3.5 hours, and mostly consisted of deleting now-redundant
code and changing function calls and interfaces.&nbsp; I'm very glad to see the
IDirect3DTexture, IDirect3DViewport, and IDirect3DLight interfaces gone, and replaced by
much simpler state-setting code.&nbsp; Direct3D's abuses of object-oriented programming
are now gone.</p>

<p>With DirectX7, Microsoft did something I welcome, and would like to see more of: they
designed the new Direct3D interfaces to <i>not</i> be backwards-compatible with the old
ones.&nbsp; This enabled them to remove from view a bunch of the old baggage that
obfuscated Direct3D: execute buffers are gone, unnecessary intermediate objects are gone,
and much less weird COM QueryInterface stuff is necessary.</p>

<p>Ripping out old code and replacing it with new, better designed code is a great
practice which too many software developers are afraid of.</p>
