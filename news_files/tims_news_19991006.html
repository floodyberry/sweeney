<h4>Windows 2000 RC2 Rocks!</h4>

<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 2000 Release Candidate 2, and wanted to mention that
it's extremely solid!&nbsp; With NVidia's latest Windows 2000 TNT/GeForce drivers,
DirectX7's Direct3D and OpenGL both work flawlessly.&nbsp; What's cool about the new OS:</p> 


<ul>
  <li>High-performance DirectX7 Direct3D and OpenGL support.</li>
  <li>USB mouse support -- mouse movement is <i>very</i> smooth.</li>
  <li>Much more stable than Windows 98, especially for software development.</li>
  <li>Good administration tools, more powerful than NT4 and far easier to use.</li>
  <li>Great international support.</li>

  <li>Dual processor support.</li>
  <li>Plug and play.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Windows 2000 Internationalization</h4>

<p>This is a topic we're very interested in, because we're always trying to make our games
and engine as widely accessible as possible.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, today I'm working
out the font management issues for the Japanese version of Unreal Tournament.</p>

<p>The Windows 95/98 OS had very weak international support, and a confusing array of
incomplete features such as supporting Unicode in a few API's but not all, weird and
undocumented multibyte character set handling, and mixed ANSI/OEM file system
conventions.&nbsp; Localizing Windows 9X apps is a very difficult undertaking.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Windows 2000 is by far the most thoroughly internationalized piece
of software I've ever seen.&nbsp; All international versions sharing the same binaries,
fonts, and input support. Everything is 100% Unicode.&nbsp; So, you can open up a Japanese
language document on your English computer, visit Arabic web sites, use an Input Method
Editor to type in Chinese text, and so on.&nbsp; While most people might not care about
that, it's infinitely beneficial for developers to have that power at their fingertips,
because it enables you to do all of your international development and most of your
testing without jumping through hoops and installing multiple OS's.</p>

<p>When Windows 2000 makes its transition into the consumer OS market, it will be a great
day for worldwide software development.</p>
