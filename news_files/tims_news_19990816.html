<h4>Unreal Tournament development note</h4>

<p>In response to the pirate punk who has been claiming to have a &quot;final&quot;
version of UT...</p>

<p>Unreal Tournament isn't finished yet, so there isn't a final version. We're still
polishing, fine-tuning, and optimizing the game and will 'till it's done.</p>

<p>Believe me, when UT goes gold, we'll be announcing it here prominently.</p>

<p>Until the demo and release version are available, any copy of UT you see is an
unfinished beta version; unless you're a reviewer who received such a copy direct from
Epic or GT, having such a copy is illegal. These versions are clearly labeled
&quot;confidential beta version&quot; or &quot;release candidate - not for
distribution&quot; in at least 5 places in the program. In addition, they have time-bomb
logic which will cause them to stop functioning after a certain amount of time. So if
anybody gets hold of a version of UT before release, it should be pretty clear that it's
not legitimate.</p>
