<h4>The AMD Athlon Rocks!</h4>

<p>My new 550 MHz <a href="http://www.amd.com/products/cpg/athlon/index.html">AMD Athlon</a> (K7) just clocked a jaw-dropping 68.5 Unreal timedemo at
1024x768, running on a Voodoo3 3000 card.&nbsp; Even more telling, at no point did the
frame rate ever drop below 38.0 fps.&nbsp; That's astounding, considering the intense
lightmap and geometry usage in the timedemo level.&nbsp; Even while playing Unreal
Tournament's most texture and polygon intensive level (Shane Caudle's DmGothic), the frame
rate hardly ever went below 60 fps.</p>

<p>The Athlon's 128K L1 cache is awesome for memory-intensive games like Unreal. &nbsp;

Operations like visibility determination, which thrash on the Pentium III's 32K cache, now
run at full speed on the Athlon.&nbsp; This CPU truly shows a generational performance
improvement, like going from my old 486 to my first Pentium.</p>

<p>When I saw AMD's K7 spec, I was pretty skeptical.&nbsp; The K6 had been hyped up, but
in reality it was slower for Unreal than a Pentium II of comparable clock rate, due to its
poor non-SIMD floating point performance.&nbsp; The K7 claimed to fix all of that, and
debut a new architecture with 3 execution pipelines.&nbsp; I decided to wait and see,
without getting my hopes up.</p>

<p>Bottom line: I waited, and now I have seen!&nbsp; The Athlon is clearly the fastest x86
CPU at any clock speed.</p>

<p>Congratulations go to AMD.</p>

<p>My wish list: </p>

<ul>
  <li>I want to be able to buy dual-processor Athlon workstations from major manufacturers
    like Dell and Gateway.</li>
  <li>I want MMX, 3DNow! and SSE code generation support in Visual C++, with native SIMD C/C++
    datatypes like float2, float4, and short4, making the compiler manage all register
    allocation and code generation.</li>
  <li>I want <a href="http://www.kryotech.com/sgindex.asp">one of these</a>!
    8-)</li>

</ul>
