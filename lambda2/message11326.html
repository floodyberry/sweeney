Another cool example from Oleg. This time, not only a nice example of Scheme macros, but of shift/reset operators as well.<p>
<font color="blue"><i>
Allow me to draw the following diagram:
<p>
list-comprehensions === monads === shift/reset === range
<p>
The first two are truly equivalences: in Haskell, a list comprehension
is just another form of the 'do' notation in the case of a List monad.
Filinski showed that shift/reset can be used to implement monads in
the general way. My 'range' is based on shift-and-reset. <p>
There is a difference however. If we avoid nested loops, then my
shift/reset (called bshift/breset) are the same as shift/reset. Alas,
regular shift/reset cannot nest. There are multi-level shift/reset,
but they are difficult to use -- and hard to encapsulate in a macro
such as 'range' because the macro needs to know on which level it
operates. My bshift/breset are different. bshift/breset with different
labels are unaware of each other.
<p>
BTW, other control operators, e.g., those by Matthias Felleisen, do
not have the indifference property. The operator 'cupto' has -- but to
some extent. Several cupto operators have to be used in a stack-wise
fashion. Mines don't have to.</i></font><p><br>

I've been trying to sort out these similarities too.  There is also a notion of a Monad with a "cut" operator similar to the Prolog cut operation discarding prior choice points; something along these lines may be valuable in modelling a array monad analogy to the "break" command in C for loops.  (The "continue" command is already modelled by the array monad's zero.)<p>

The presence of operations with side effects in things like list comprehensions complicates their interpretation as monads.  One approach I find promising is to model all imperative operations in a program literally as IO monads, and to have a syntactic translation of things like for loops or list comprehensions whose contents have side effects into a simple composition of the Array or Maybe monad with the IO monad.  Obviously this translation will only work for a predetermined set of monads (because not every monad can be composed with IO so as to yield a true monad as a result), but it would be nice to be able to model all imperative constructs and looping constructs with a mainstream-style syntax (as opposed to Haskell syntax) with the monad translation being automatic.<p>

Note that in a suitable type system, you can construct a "TypeMonad" whose map functor takes the (exact) image of a supplied function over a supplied type, unit generates a singleton type containing just the supplied element, join is type union, and zero is the empty type.<p>

The really neat thing is that comprehensions in the TypeMonad correspond to constructing new types elementwise from existing types, i.e. for(a:at,b:bt)[a,b] is the type of pairs containing elements from the types at and bt.  And in the IdentityMonad, comprehensions correspond to lets: for(a:x,b:y)a+b is just x+y.  So, many of the leading edge syntactic constructs in languages can be represented as comprehensions over a suitable monad.

Pardon the spam, but here are some more notes:<p>

The TypeMonad described above also can be extended with a new "meet" operating (taking typewise intersection) and "infinity" object ("the type of all types" if it exists and is nonparadoxical in a given type system) as its idempotnent.  This structure can then be seen as a lattice or a topos or a model of set theory depending on what you want from it. However, TypeMonad can't be sensibly composed with IO, because elements in a set are inherently ordered, in contrast to elements of a list of array.<p>

Finally, there is a concept of a monad with a fixed-point operation (see <a href="http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/projects/rmb/mdoTalk.pdf">http://www.cse.ogi.edu/PacSoft/projects/rmb/mdoTalk.pdf</a>), which leads to the interesting possibility of accessing the previous results of a list comprehension while constructing subsequent elements.
