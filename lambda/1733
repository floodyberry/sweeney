<p >'BASIC used to be on every computer a child touched -- but today there's no easy way for kids to get hooked on programming.'</p>
<p >I have to say that, much as I love more modern higher-level languages (why else would I be here), BASIC was what I grew up on, and really was ideal for picking up a first understanding of what programming is all about. With its global variables, GOTOs and all. It gets the computer obeying your command and following your logic with the absolute minimum learning curve. You don't have to learn any more abstractions than are absolutely necessary in order to feel that power (wow, it actually does what I tell it to, step by step!) and get yourself hooked. </p> </div>

 <div class="content"><p >Early programming languages like BASIC were line-oriented because the user's interface to them was a teletype.  Back then, there were also line-oriented text editors, where you'd type a bunch of lines, and then edit by saying "on line 3, replace 'teh' by 'the'".</p>
<p >Soon after actual video display terminals arose, text editors became screen-oriented, and programming languages became file-oriented.  Seems like progress.</p>

 Too true -- every high school CS/IT classroom I've been in lately has used VB (most) or Java (few). I'm currently developing a high-school course for Prolog in an attempt to help broaden at least some student's horizons, though I won't be able to try it out in a classroom until some time next year.</p></div>

 <div class="content"><p >I remember enjoying LOGO a lot too. It was never really taught (to me at least) as a programming language, though, more just as a drawing tool for kids to play with the fun robot turtle, and a way to help kids understand angles and geometry. Figuring out how to plot fractal trees with it was interesting, but it has a bit of a higher-level feel to it, and the control flow wasn't quite as blindingly obvious as BASIC's line-numbers and GOTOs. For me at least, as a kid.</p></div>

 <h3 class="title"><a href="node/1733#comment-21129" class="active">For what ages are we talking?</a></h3>
 <div class="content"><p >Logo might be suitable for younger children...as a teenager, I remember that having the option to use Logo or Basic on the Amstrad 6128, I chose Basic, because it felt a more 'mature' tool, and everything else was coded in Basic too.</p>
<p >I think though that the Basic model (i.e. a program is a list of commands) is a very simple model that sits well with the young minds...other models like object orientated or functional programming are more complex and therefore maybe unsuitable for first teachings.</p>
<p >On the other hand, starting with a pure functional language maybe is better in the long run, because the programmer's mind is not 'littered' with the imperative model. I think it is easier to go to imperative from functional than the other way around.</p>
<p >I think that one of the reasons that 'Johny can't code' is because programming languages are not as accessible as they were. Today's languages include huge and scary IDEs, projects and solutions, huge APIs and a level of knowledge that is scary for beginners. Even the available Basic languages are not that simple. For example, in order to draw something on the screen, the programmer has to open a window, create a class, get a device context etc. And the plethora of choices does not help either.</p></div>

<p >For lots of beginner-type programming problems (e.g., converting a string to an integer), yes, I agree that pure functional programming would be better.  But there's definitely something to be said for incrementally updating data structures and interactively inspecting them.</p></div>

 <div class="content"><p >Growing up I had regular access to an Apple //e and a TI-99/4A.  Both these computers presented a command prompt where I could play with BASIC commands (including graphical ones), write programs, and dissect and edit other programs.  Web browsers provide no such environment - at best, Firefox's JavaScript console provides a limited REPL, but it's hard to get any good interaction going without a knowledge of HTML and the browser's DOM.</p>
<p >Of all languages, Python reminds me most of my years learning BASIC.  It provides a REPL, and other programs (including the standard library) can be dissected and learned from.  What's more, it provides online help and a "turtle" graphics interface.  The "RUR-PLE" environment grant mentioned below is a beautiful example of how Python can be used as a teaching tool.</p></div>

<p >modern educational tools like <a href="http://www.swisseduc.ch/compscience/karatojava/">kara</a> avoid this problem and allow entry level education at very young age. kara is a graphical interface for building finite state machines. it teaches the underlying concept of program evaluation (in obviously non-functional context) without the complexity of programming languages.</p>

<p >learning a programming language is simple. in the end, in comparison to natural languages, it is nothing else but a syntactically and semantically nearly trivial foreign language.</p>

On my BBC Micro years ago I could type a command to go into a 'high-res' graphics mode and then start interactively typing in graphics commands. Within 5 seconds of switching it on I could have graphics of my own creation on the screen. In a modern OS I have to write a few hundred lines of code just to grab a window reliably, and when I've done that, I can't experiment interactively. Kids need instant feedback.

A wiki like environment for interactively sharing  source code is part of the e-learning vision I articulated recently. Domain specific languages for learning specific subjects should support such a wiki infrastructure (called "wiki-source" in my slides, if you came across them - basically a wikipedia style repository, based on sharing the DSL code, and rendering it automatically). </p></div>

 <div class="content"><p >I think it is worth noting that the ultimate goal of Logo wasn't to teach programming but rather to teach or develop mathematical thinking in kids <i >via</i> programming. I think that the notion of learning via programming can (and should) be extended to other domains. This was the subject of my talk I briefly mentioned <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1664">here</a>. The approach I envision relies heavily on DSLs, tailored to learning and interacting with specific subjects.</p></div>

 <h3 class="title"><a href="node/1733#comment-21144" class="active">Learning</a></h3>
 <div class="content"><p >I was reading over the comments to this story when it hit slashdot a few days ago.  Someone there (sorry, don't remember who) had made an excellent point as to, perhaps, the real nature of the problem the author was writing about:  simply knowing that's it's even possible.</p>
<p >In a modern setting, you buy your new machine, take it home, and it boots up to Windows and you've got everything there in front of you to just click on stuff and make things happen.  In the good old days, you turned on the machine and were dropped at a prompt where you had to type commands just to load your favorite games.  That would naturally lead the curious into wondering what else they can type there.  Next thing you know, they're reading BASIC books and making cool little games or whatever.</p>
<p >I think the author is really lamenting the fact that things aren't like that anymore and while he has the experience required to help his kid(s) get into the technical side of computers, I kind of took away from his article that a part of him is worried about the future as a whole.  What about all the kids who don't have technical parents or influences?  How will those kids even know they can have power over their machines in the first place?  That sort of thing.</p>
<p >Is there a solution to that?  I don't know.  It's hard to say if it even needs an explicit solution because those who are driven will figure it out somehow.  I think there's enough information out there that simple google searches will lead down a path to programming enlightenment eventually.  It just might not be as obvious or easy as it was way back when.  Or perhaps it just isn't as obvious to those of us who grew up without GUIs.</p></div>

 <div class="content"><p >Glad to notice that at least one person got the point. </p>
<p >The culture of programming in which BASIC was once a key element is just over. Instead deprived languages such as JavaScript are advocated here and elsewhere, not because they let people "feel the machine" - on the contrary: all <i >modern</i> programming languages are dedicated not to feel it but living in increasingly abstract phantasies instead - but they share some superficial similarities ( simplicity / being widespreaded ). "Controlling the machine" by a single individual is the ideal of another generation which lead not-surprisingly also the political discourse of emancipation. Today software is just another industrial product that requires division of labour for avoiding to be sub-standard. Even the creation of computer games will be guided by scientific theories. This way BASIC turns back as some kind of ghost and as a medieval romanticism: a crufty, spaghetti producing, dark age computing language that lead people less alienated and deprived after all.</p></div>

Evidently there's more of this going on than I thought, with junior-high robotics clubs and competitions becoming more common.  Robotics has a lot to recommend it over graphics for introductory programming: more interactive, less abstract, absurdly simple programming models, and problems ramping from the trivial to the mind-expanding.  </p></div>

 <div class="content"><p >Although today's computers come with web browsers, which in turn come with Javascript, (and moreover most OSes come with gcc), they still omit one thing curiously, and it is also curiously missing in the foregoing discussion: introductory programming tutorials.</p>
<p >Some of my first computers were BASIC-capable calculators, specifically Casio FX-702P and Sharp PC-1500. Their manuals taught very introductory programming, and some ideas taught were not language-specific. For example, the 702P manual taught flow charts; the 1500 manual advised you to "group only those statements which are conceptually related" (on writing like <code >40 stmt1 : stmt2 : stmt3</code>); both introduced <code >GOSUB</code> as a factoring construct. Each came with a second book full of programs, and one could have a lot to read. Each of course also suggested further, more serious programming books.</p>
<p >Yes of course similar books are available at bookstores, in libraries, and on the Internet. But from the perspective of a child receiving the gift of a computer package for the first time: what is exposed visibly out of the box is influential to how you think you are expected to play with this new toy. If the manual does not showcase programming, if the desktop icons refer to just surfing and games, you will not be aware of its programmability for a long, long time.</p>
<p >The solution is easy though. Give the gift of a programming book too (or a URL).</p></div>

 <div class="content"><p >Other kid-oriented structure editors I've seen are Carnegie Mellon's <a href="http://www.alice.org/">Alice</a> and Berkley's <a href="http://dewey.soe.berkeley.edu/boxer/">Boxer</a>. I do believe assisted realtime manipulation of the AST is the way forward here, providing a level of transparency and safety at input time that you just don't get with the dumb character buffer and separate parse-compile stage of older-style environments. For average computer users it'll be like the difference between DOS and Windows.</p>
<p >Incidentally, I wonder if Apple might go this route if/when they eventually get around to replacing AppleScript, given that they're already dabbling in this general area with Automator and Quartz Composer. The major OS vendors are in the ideal position for getting these technologies from the research labs onto every user's desktop, after all. I guess the big question will be whether or not they've any motivation to do so.</p></div>
