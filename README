BUILDING THE SITE

* Run page_tools/page_compile.php from the browser or command line (I think)
* The site will be generated to the root directory, and 
  files/[name]_archive.zip will contain a full archive of the site you can
  unzip anywhere
* Run pdf_tools/page_compile.php to generate .tex files to the pdf/ directory
* .pdf filse are generated using Miktex and Texnic (add-ons will need to be
  installed on-demand on first run) by running the .bat files in the pdf/ 
  directory


WORKING WITH THE SUB-PAGES AND DATA FILES

* Good luck!
