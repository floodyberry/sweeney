\chapter{Introduction}

This is a collection of Tim Sweeney's posts to Lambda the Ultimate, a programming weblog which \textit{"deals with issues directly related to programming languages, and programming language research"}.

Some posts may not be formatted properly or may contain incomplete code fragments. This seems to be a defect of the Lambda the Ultimate posting system, which has partially eaten a handful of posts and on the whole produced html and xhtml that is not what one would call "well formed." Adjustments and corrections have been made where possible.
