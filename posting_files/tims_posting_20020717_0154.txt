[comp.lang.functional] Re: Extending Church Numerals to integers, rationals
I wasn't expecting someone to mention ZZT here! :-)  Once in a while I take a short break from game programming and work on an interesting side-project.  Currently I'm fascinated with the applications of type theory, and am experimenting with extensions that increase expressiveness at the expense of decidable typechecking and possibly even reduction.

Regarding Church Numerals, another thought along these lines is to extend the lambda calculus with a new primitive "-1", not itself definable as a finite lambda term, and define a new (possibly incomplete) reduction rule for it which captures the essence of a negative church numeral: that for all terms f and x, f(-1(f)(x))=-1(f)(f(x))=id.

It was mentioned that -1 is the fixed point of y=y+y+1, but that leads to an infinite expansion that does not appear to be computationally useful.

It is interesting to restate a problem such as "y such that f(y) = x", as -1(f)(x).  Not that this causes a solution to magically appear! But it does move the problem from solving an equation to evaluating an expression in a lambda calculus augumented with the primitive "-1".

The notion of negative Church Numeral terms makes varying degrees of sense in different calculi.  It is most interesting in a logic programming framework supporting terms with multiple "potential" values such as McAllester's Ontic: http://www.autoreason.com/.  In this sort of framework, it seems that every function has a unique and perfectly sensible (though possibly multivalued, and not necessarily computable) inverse.

Regarding exponentiation ("a^b = lambda(f).lambda(g).g(f)"), this agrees with convention for all natural numbers, except for the somewhat questionable case of 0^0=0.

[Disclaimer: I'm presenting this experimentally and have not attempted to prove the soundness of the proposed extensions.]
