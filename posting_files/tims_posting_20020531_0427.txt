[sci.fractals] The nth iteration of f(x)=x^2+c
Here I will use the notation f^-1(x) for the inverse function of f(x), and in general f^n(x) for the nth iteration of f(x).  For example, f^3(x) = f(f(f(x))).

Some obvious identities involving iterated functions are:

   if f(x)=x+c then f^n(x)=x+nc
   if f(x)=x*c then f^n(x)=x*c^n

A few more identities can be derived in closed form, such as f(x)=a*x+b.  However, deriving a general formula for f^n(x) turns out to be remarkably hard, even for simple f.

Now, given f(x)=g(h(g^-1(x))), it's easy to see that f(f(x))=g(h(h(g^-1(x))).

And more generally, f^n(x)=g(h^n(g^-1(x))).

This identity is useful for determining the nth iteration of a function f(x), when we can represent f(x) as a composition of the functions g and h, where h is a function simple enough to determine h^n(x) directly.

For example, we know that

   2*cos(x)^2-1=cos(2*x)

Replacing x with arccos(x), we have

   2*x^2-1=cos(2*arccos(x))

Now, cos(2*arccos(x)) is of the form g(h(g^1(x))) where g(x)=cos(x) and h(x)=2x.  Therefore, we derive

   if f(x)=2*x^2-1    then f^n(x)=cos(2^n*arccos(x))

When I derived this result 13 years ago, it went a great way towards understanding the behaviour of chaotic dynamic systems: in iterating 2*x^2-1 many times, one quickly notices that small perturbations of the input value have a dramatic effect on later results.  The mechanism for this becomes much less mysterious when you consider the equation cos(2^n*arccos(x)) as n grows large: the function is zooming through oscillations of the cosine function at an exponential rate.

With some simple scaling that doesn't affect the end results, one can transform these equations to

   f(x)=x^2-1/2

Which just happens to be a point on the Mandelbrot set (defined by iterations of f(x)=x^2+c) where c=-1/2+0i.

So, I have a few questions related to this topic:

1. Are there any studies or research papers on the general study of determining f^n(x) for various functions?

2. Is a closed-form solution known for f^n(x) given f(x)=x^2+c?

3. Are there any studies or general results on f^n(x) where n is:

   - Rational.  Such a notation is clearly meaningful, i.e. f^2/3(x) is the function g(x) such that f(f(x))=g(g(g(x))).

   - Real, i.e. f^pi(x).  The iterative meaning of such a notation isn't obvious but from the obvious example of f(x)=x+c implying that f^n(x)=x+n*c it seems that such an extension could be defined.

Thanks,
