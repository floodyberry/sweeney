[comp.graphics.algorithms] Re: BSP Tree Balancing

When picking a splitter polygon, rank all polygons based on a function like this:

[code]
   Score =
      (
      (FLOAT)Balance *       (FLOAT)(OurAbs(Front-Back)) +
      (FLOAT)(100-Balance) * (FLOAT)Splits
      );
[/code]

Where:

Balance = 0-100, tendency to balance tree rather than minimize cuts, 15-25 works well.

Front  = polygons in front 
Back   = polygons in back 
Splits = polygons split

For typical complex objects, the polygon count only increases by 20-30% after BSP'ing.
