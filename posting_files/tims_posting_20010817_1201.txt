[D] Int to string
Using "+" for string concatenation always leads to confusing ambiguities. In a language without overloading or templates, this can still work, but requires the user to sometimes perform mental gymnastics figuring out "why am I getting weird results using + in this context?"

However, if templates or overloading are present, then you run into even worse ambiguity problems.  To avoid ambiguity, you really need to have separate syntax for:

[code]adding (i.e. integers).
concatenating arrays (strings just like any other case).
prepending one t to a t[].
appending one t to a t[].[/code]
Note that this is provable rather than speculation. :-)

[blockquote]In D strings can be copied, compared, concatenated, and appended like

[code]str1 = str2;
if (str1 < str3) ...
func(str3 + str4);
str4 += str1;[/code]
But if you want to add a integer into this, does(or will) D support it this(or in some simmilar way)?

[code]int i=10;
char[] str = "abc";

str1 = i;         // str1="10"
if (str == i) ...
func(str + i);    // abc10
str += i;         //same as above[/code][/blockquote]
