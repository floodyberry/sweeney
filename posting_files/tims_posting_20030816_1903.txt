[comp.lang.functional] Terminology: sgn, abs, normal, magnitude
On real numbers, the "abs" and "sgn" are commonly defined as:

[code]
abs(x) = x if x>0, 0 if x=0, -1 if x<0
sgn(x) = 1 if x>0, 0 if x=0, -1 if x<0
[/code]

In many kinds of vector space (in this case, a 3d vector space), the "magnitude" and "normalize" operations are commonly defined as:

[code]
magnitude(v) = v.x^2 + v.y^2 + v.z^2
normalize(v) = v / (v.x^2 + v.y^2 + v.z^2) if v<>0, 0 otherwise
[/code]

These operations obey the identities:

[code]
abs(x) = x*sgn(x)
sgn(x) = lim(y->x) y/abs(y)

magnitude(v) = v*normalize(v) (where * is the inner product operation)
normalize(v) = lim(w->v) w/magnitude(w)
[/code]

So, from a certain point of view these two sets of operations represent the same notion: "absolute value" and "magnitude" represent the directionless size of a number or vector, while "sign" and "normalize" represent the sizeless direction of a number or vector.

QUESTION: Is there a name for or formalization of this generalized notion of "size" and "direction"?  And exactly what is the minimal set of spaces upon which these operations are generally defined?

From my informal Google search on this topic, it sounds like the "normed vector spaces" (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormedSpace.html) are what I'm looking for.  If this is the answer, then would it be considered kosher to view the real numbers as a normed vector space (over the real numbers themselves), where the norm is simply the absolute value?

The context of the question is this: I'm writing a computer math library, and am looking for the appropriate set of types over which the sgn/abs/magnitude/normalize functions can be defined generally, and am looking for an abstraction and nomenclature which will offend the fewest people possible.
