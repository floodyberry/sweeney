[sci.math] Constructing the integers from set theory without equivalance classes

There exist many simple ways to construct the natural numbers from set theory, such as:

0   = {}
n+1 = {n,{n}}

Then one typically constructs the integers from equivalance classes of pairs of natural numbers, such that:

{a0,{a1}}={b0,{b1}} iff a0+b1=a1+b0

Is there a simple way to construct the integers directly from set theory, without making use of equivalance classes?  In other words, I'm looking for a simple representation of the integers such that each integer is represented by a unique set, rather than an equivalance class of sets.

As a bonus it would be nice if the representation admitted a straightforward definition of addition, subtraction and multiplication.

Thanks,
