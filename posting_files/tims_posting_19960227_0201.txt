[comp.graphics.algorithms] Re: HYPERBOLIC MAPPING, complete explanation
This is a very clever trick.  I was working on a method similar to this a few months ago, but dropped it after a few hours of experimentation because of temporal problems.  It produced great stills, but moving textures jiggled.  I might have been missing something, though.  Have you run your texture mapper at realtime speeds?  Does it have this aliasing problem?
