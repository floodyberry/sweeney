[slashdot] A few notes
Regarding documentation, check out the Unreal Developer Network for a huge amount of documentation.

Also, the 3D Buzz team has created many excellent training videos covering many aspects of the Unreal tech, from programming to content creation.

[blockquote]Ultimately, the developer of such a mod should be fairly compensated based on the popularity and ultimately, the sales, of their mod, not a one-time payout.[/blockquote]

The mod developer keeps complete ownership of his work. The contest doesn't take that away.

For example, if you enter an early version of your mod in the contest, you could later create a retail game based on it and pursue a publishing deal. The Tactical Ops mod for the original Unreal Tournament went this route and was published in retail by Atari.

Regarding tax issues, one should definitely consult a tax attourney upon making the finals for the grand prize. My understanding (IANAL) is that, if we gave you a $350K cash prize, that would be revenue for your mod team's corporation or small business. If you then spent that $350K on an Unreal engine license with the intent of using it commercially (which is the only reason one would want such a license), you would then incur a $350K expense, leaving a net tax liability of zero. So a direct award of an engine license is not necessarily a taxable event.
