[sci.math.symbolic] Re: Repeated exponentiation n@m
Also, google for "Knuth's arrow" operator.  It's the general case of addition/multiplication/exponentiation for arbitrary iterations.  Also related is Ackermann's function.

As far as I understand it, these operations and their inverses are closed over the complex numbers, so no new number systems need to be introduced to study them completely.
