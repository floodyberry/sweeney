[comp.lang.c] Re: Parity of a number
[blockquote]His code is wrong but his statement is right, and your statement about a worst-case complexity of Theta(n) for the parity of an n-bit number is wrong.  Consider the following code:

int uint16_parity( uint16 x ) {
x = x ^ (x >> 8);
x = x ^ (x >> 4);
x = x ^ (x >> 2);
x = x ^ (x >> 1);
return x & 1;
}

Gunnar,

Thanks for the correction.  I should've known better than to post a piece of code without testing it. :-)
