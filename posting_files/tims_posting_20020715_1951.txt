[sci.math] Re: Hestenes' Geometric Algebra
[blockquote]I have downloaded a lot of papers by David Hestenes and others on geometric algebra and am reading the book Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus by Hestenes,but I am still looking for some pratical examples of calculations done using this system of geometric algebra.  Does anyone know of any examples?[/blockquote]

Hello,

In writing 3D graphics code in C++, I've used geometric algebra to represent points (3D vectors), planes (3D bivectors), and quaternions (3D spinors, the sum of a bivector and a scalar).  This approach works quite well, though I haven't yet found any fundamental improvements in using geometric algebra over more traditional matrix approaches.

Hestenes presets the basis-free nature of geometric algebra as one of its biggest strengths, but if you're a computer guy, the first thing you'll do in writing a geometric algebra library is to make the basis explicit.
