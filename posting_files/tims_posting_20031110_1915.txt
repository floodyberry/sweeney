[sci.math] Re: Ordering a Power Set
[blockquote]This question arises from economics, but I'll give you the question first, the context later: Suppose we have a set of n objects, and a binary relation S that is a linear ordering, ie irreflexive, asymmetric, complete, transitive.  Is there any way to use this relation to induce some soft of ordering on the power set of our set of objects?[/blockquote]

Yes: Associate each (finite) set with a sorted array containing exactly those elements in that set, and use the lexocographic (dictionary) order of those arrays. It will also be a linear order with a minimum element (the empty array) but no maximum element.
